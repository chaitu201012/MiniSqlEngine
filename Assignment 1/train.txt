Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .	0.6641641022781901
Although , as you will have seen , the dreaded 'millennium bug ' failed to materialise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .	0.01254004363588631
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part-session .	0.229370891782383
In the meantime , I should like to observe a minute ' s silence , as a number of Members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible storms , in the various countries of the European Union .	0.0015251720880786715
Please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .	2.509807279815299e-05
(The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence ) Madam President , on a point of order .	0.0840076828838846
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka .	7.850420817353076
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .	0.5126145443733567
Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?	0.09853386125446446
Yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .	0.006245034719791801
If the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .	0.05655747373094447
Madam President , on a point of order .	0.0005444882577981246
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .	22.224055235044094
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .	8.914068677194685
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .	4.214658946820306
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .	11.602975519752135
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .	8.980812093939404
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday .	0.07926837626732938
That is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e . on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .	0.0004485141354966801
Madam President , coinciding with this year ' s first part-session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death .	0.0013165028878767315
We shall call him Mr Hicks .	34.661913721082996
At the request of a French Member , Mr Zimeray , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .	0.00011527899220183461
However , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person .	0.00394219283973154
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .	19.820697537116246
Thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .	2.7047249050485615e-05
Indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .	0.09834522854454832
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .	0.10187344099305419
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin .	62.61183005408135
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .	0.04212125791368391
Now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .	0.0046402253028709674
We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .	0.05767225746512621
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned .	0.09308128458476107
Yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter .	0.010635455916203207
Madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .	0.01658108834635765
But , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .	0.00024703338294847026
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one , there is still no Dutch channel , which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month .	0.17878329691870354
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .	12.335528371264404
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday .	0.29133679289507536
It will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .	3.5147360707031255e-05
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?	0.03545444647534077
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?	1.9050679377403512
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?	1.6012911224798754
Why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?	0.040074816579307275
Why are there no fire instructions ?	1.345899803495584
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ?	1.5544054418136142
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced ?	1.3458995130409694
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .	9.845996534075951
Mrs Lynne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .	0.040246346194147097
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .	0.5363427803977264
Madam President , Mrs Dez Gonzlez and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .	0.0017547443541766831
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session .	6.777221687018712
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .	0.05897528919029819
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio ' s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November .	0.03982833101849522
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .	0.020593348536415364
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .	0.0004594985705759054
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .	6.865903037046518
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ?	0.10636266608869559
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .	8.064461413276954
So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .	0.09275786710809585
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .	13.154495634487102
As people have said , the situation there is extremely volatile .	0.026387758109858
There is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .	0.00010502066521623336
We do not know what is happening .	22.477434566626336
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?	1.8351893879312602
In any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .	0.17182101325078084
Agenda The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .	3.4823533303978147
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .	17.782902291045747
Relating to Wednesday : The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission .	0.4538809745372637
I would like Mr Barn Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it .	0.00335462230912069
That is , if he so wishes , of course .	5.4215722830179845e-06
Then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .	0.12292297573394732
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission ' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech .	0.22622104930171566
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this Parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years .	0.10654819858891235
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature .	0.011834911265953478
It did so again during this legislature , in July , and then , in September , it voted once more to approve the whole Commission .	4.697022070004971e-05
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .	6.2239465792002235
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .	0.02908368549565953
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma .	0.3730286192015431
Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .	0.14040263484669788
According to its President , it is in a position to do so .	0.02805021521246193
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed .	0.0017854045753556624
Alternatively , Parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .	0.0034150218586699184
In my opinion , this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament , as well as introducing an original thesis , an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware , in writing , of a speech concerning the Commission ' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier , as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February , so we could forego the debate , since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it .	0.01699246118502708
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens .	0.03289837104926735
Therefore , the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , and which you have mentioned , is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday , including its proposed administrative reform , because , otherwise , we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation : on the pretext that there is no text , on the one hand , the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based .	0.0
Therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .	0.029326000065504284
(Applause from the PSE Group ) Madam President , I would like to make it very clear that , above all , the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and , amongst those , the decision establishing its agenda .	0.0005614177992500013
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide .	25.246755233435973
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate , as Mr Barn Crespo has reminded us , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission ' s legislative programme , on the broad areas of action for the next five years , that is to say , for this legislature .	0.014685676805254327
Madam President , I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission ' s legislative programme .	0.1928236822586387
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally , on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups .	1.1317228254561578
Therefore , Madam President , I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and , when Parliament decides , - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and , next month , the programme for 2000 , which is what we fully agreed upon .	0.001933793152671438
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated .	6.747145811109195
(Parliament rejected the request ) President .	42.02215330778929
Still on the subject of Wednesday ' s sitting , I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .	0.1946304177849597
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .	6.563241696998311
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?	2.4130551220186764
Madam President , I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists .	0.011413283160875096
I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .	0.8754040948464428
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already .	0.01101721111437857
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .	9.43068486202475
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .	7.552079596681811
Thank you , Mr Poettering .	1.5402618163536875e-05
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request .	14.033458464181182
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering ' s lack of logic .	0.037675489091611364
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents , and now he is doing just the same .	0.4971671463057192
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups .	0.13780628516646312
As my fellow chairmen will recall , I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it .	0.1360367573679289
It is not a lot to ask .	38.935406441134845
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference .	0.12376288371672524
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .	6.467195681287539
(Parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions ) Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .	0.006849797917048852
Thank you very much .	31.167929532936945
Madam President , has my vote been counted ?	4.218414827738761e-05
I was unable to vote electronically , since I do not have a card .	0.10659386930776336
My vote was "in favour " .	34.66191718500847
Indeed , if we add the two Members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be ... .	0.0005603942897184233
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .	0.010770941535843879
There is no room for amendments .	52.570840892210754
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .	0.6955932317564192
That did not happen .	57.77930188662333
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .	0.03435491293459412
This is an important matter .	57.74358342842973
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .	8.851749589939303
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barn Crespo's motion .	0.0012738214429200028
You did not call me either .	37.79908857199049
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .	0.24290205131012
I am terribly sorry , Mr Hnsch and Mr Cox .	0.03692158072861823
I did not see you asking to speak .	18.280305605520475
Even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .	0.03365088131432648
When we adopt the Minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .	0.48186638425688105
This seems to me to be a workable solution .	32.19355278024254
Of course , the Minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .	0.048237141368596255
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes .	8.818084346192386
Mr Cox , Mr Hnsch , would this be acceptable to you ?	3.88377729407982e-06
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and cannot , object to that .	0.00010318462360922432
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations .	0.16175855847187387
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .	0.002321764372293992
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .	0.0026484092646473674
(The order of business was adopted thus amended ) Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD) .	0.07900291318510853
Commissioner , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .	0.0034858808938254323
Firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC , which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .	0.05952382961465289
Secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped ; b ) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market .	0.27613849668762136
Thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility .	0.014560750587271321
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .	11.59078994446582
Our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .	0.0020483710411861693
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .	0.19691097288437984
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .	0.04998575210007623
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .	0.859656280236039
I would urge you to endorse this .	25.32586609774621
Madam President , we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster .	0.21804668403001626
As an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .	0.0018225140486994554
The renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .	0.010718217628053951
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .	7.516739658624593
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .	0.016405472903631414
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .	0.5914546239262986
All the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety .	0.09418065207808107
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .	6.902423721643288
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .	7.508396868493035
I should like to address one final point .	27.9662247352851
We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .	0.07015187575476634
In this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .	0.04164188935341543
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .	0.0013247304616442884
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterway .	0.44836681327947564
I congratulate him on his excellent report .	20.028425838379935
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the Paddington rail crash in London , the terrible rail crash in Norway , the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified .	0.1591324146723311
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained .	6.295976667514915
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .	5.013807313332679
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .	8.010474588494837
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .	11.06136964722103
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .	0.004798531186463592
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .	0.0006872851787472516
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .	0.0023740394030408963
This is a pity , in a sense .	0.006524549297793538
Needless to say , safety on roads , railways and inland waterways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advisors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new ADR , for example , which is under way .	0.00013980469552079712
This is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .	0.0012936316253732256
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead .	0.15606001887733412
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .	0.16794211710307005
Furthermore , it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .	0.01044208261332713
In short , the issue is an important one .	0.0015747834270135235
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year .	0.40529196106300447
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advisors .	0.012229106672045168
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .	0.1488905965354875
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .	5.8712407348173
The work is done .	50.085031354048986
All that remains is the business of enforcement .	20.998625593152305
I would like to mention one final point .	32.222201820721416
With regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that is to say in eighteen months ' time .	0.13957051285228977
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .	13.394041153018097
This is not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland waterways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states .	0.010019063206722724
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .	0.06874423444102576
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .	0.021796465527477056
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .	13.252351989415764
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95/35/EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .	0.07070602533099497
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations , although I would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and modules had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .	0.03970226808360819
This , however , does not seem feasible .	2.2885122975662434e-05
Finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .	0.0006055667676328955
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .	0.00014600564108276527
I should like to make just a few comments .	24.737048369120625
Firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .	0.0424878814880246
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .	0.10736313017873383
This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .	0.48022988431243824
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .	0.04533361285244889
In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules .	0.11459259763266795
However , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .	0.00010642644639254793
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .	0.19622321962941636
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .	7.606120502159177
My third point has also been mentioned already .	19.160045679339863
As you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .	0.0008915765578658185
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .	6.899574376589543
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .	0.049890287523396214
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .	0.010854553882583738
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .	0.10791699382585603
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .	0.03821195000025308
Very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .	0.3203623016836356
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .	0.31090653662246115
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .	7.4209571934628
In this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels , which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of Austria , is doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .	0.0010365828698225483
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .	0.21055947142824416
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .	0.0003947652525166644
Therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .	0.19203046413964775
Finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .	0.16791436894644315
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .	0.18332778055418475
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .	8.216218048676472
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .	0.0929433152761342
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .	0.11274594594975874
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999 ) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)] .	0.03520259589507064
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 January 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that is the European Committee for Standardisation .	0.0036613015574693984
Delays in the CEN ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .	10.327015371134832
In particular , annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .	0.035604502996540506
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .	12.165833493015127
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today .	0.16967256937839056
Should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the CEN completes its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .	0.021724515983896516
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community .	4.887103573599565
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .	0.1050722960357428
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers .	0.22618947371019554
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own .	8.777726699902257
In so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .	0.21433450703511286
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 .	6.508303189265169
The proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .	0.002557856684322168
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .	8.158468975041052
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months .	6.690971043323487
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .	0.006302825270568772
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20C .	0.07624629010645227
This is in the special interest of northern European regions .	16.999667495691348
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .	5.794438430680568
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .	0.2800728668914788
Mr President , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .	0.0001986989648431127
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .	0.008740540328097795
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .	6.816319814333939
It is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .	0.004190730855134327
The Commission ' s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .	0.0023786555513656787
Consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .	0.011265524919408812
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .	8.883093727621988
According to the Commission ' s proposal -20C would have been sufficient .	20.893883997467444
On the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .	0.15728090579034257
There is support for the EU in Lapland also , so let us remember them .	0.1472849186227017
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40C .	10.20771109131543
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .	9.653852842675555
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .	9.763207852580257
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .	0.243135395256369
I thought that it was quite superb .	34.61936815856905
On the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .	0.032090914680648674
This directive is a contribution to this .	14.764333194635405
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .	23.920038568180175
The rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN , which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive .	0.017470760099140333
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .	0.2901792186543169
Mr President , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes .	4.135905262498321e-05
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .	14.24055590833004
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market .	0.11057877797321372
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU , both on roads and railways and by sea .	0.19489427052450226
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .	7.054516755723798
In area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .	0.0670277299367674
This is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Koch , for the work he has put in on this issue .	0.0009996119155048304
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .	13.68264307925862
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .	0.017230635062475127
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament , Mr Ari Vatanen .	0.048170153046883074
In many ways , the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another .	0.057971797739733606
By approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union .	0.29489281739405215
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .	5.029444834134711
It is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .	0.0016962177688079956
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .	19.05238308860979
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .	0.10159303842817712
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .	6.3346674506706115
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .	0.37633428545602593
For one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .	0.005531309361295709
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions .	11.270228953678686
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at ?	2.7290636874798015
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .	0.03875717361007804
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .	0.07559878913283906
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .	6.462260097211665
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .	0.001965696707868342
Of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature .	0.16195835990850355
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda ' s comments on the activity of the CEN , that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .	0.0502398454316758
Lastly , Mr President , the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out .	0.0020235195973779623
We have referred to the delay by the CEN , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific .	0.14934832260235073
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .	0.0019384509016309108
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .	14.715188107518172
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999 ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)] .	0.010418551604078419
Mr President , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .	0.0805679954943353
A major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .	0.008032254011878752
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .	7.275041258311229
We have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .	0.08229328626098546
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .	18.675522448202162
We are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality .	0.07524416689984408
What is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government .	0.001071147289613793
It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces .	11.97603005298998
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .	11.480888971772858
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .	28.52114211153685
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .	10.341847305160679
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .	14.989309726442572
We look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .	0.011202453878321165
Finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .	0.25039722745350373
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .	13.890419338073418
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .	15.37377877740076
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .	0.00043114195818599014
We see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee ' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .	0.426231575323217
This will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .	0.4448838029818146
Another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .	0.030031646989476093
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .	12.591685663060336
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .	0.004054047780992141
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission ' s attention to this issue .	0.00465331506830283
Finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums .	0.016096670063903373
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill .	0.03358825965648878
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .	0.5896979300250943
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .	5.910153194650486
In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .	0.10494825414911328
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .	7.368103409234381
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .	5.83039605211817
In her report , Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed .	0.014983516958637432
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .	7.768043170949201
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .	0.5697777025702713
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States ' annual national plans for employment .	0.18476870224044825
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively .	11.67152077169435
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .	0.00023328031563298274
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture ' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .	0.018447864361115406
This , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerbates the exodus from rural areas .	0.013196147426514628
The consequences do not inspire hope .	34.661918594375656
It is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .	0.056031677173732
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .	8.520755455462897
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union .	4.404058970144349
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union .	0.04818036376415397
Furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes .	0.14436373951023818
For this reason , one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas , outside of the agricultural sector , in sectors such as rural tourism , sport , culture , heritage conservation , the conversion of businesses , new technologies , services , etc .	0.0
However , even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive , it is still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns , but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land , in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment .	0.004597826608271935
Therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set .	0.2725948280349475
We want rural areas , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities .	0.012673155452160275
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17 .	0.08853107955933413
In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that , for the European Union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .	0.015064067877737022
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .	5.292126472027204e-06
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .	17.13149326892615
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .	4.690820505637285
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .	0.012133834918844474
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .	1.1110050300329484
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .	0.0032840526029378455
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative .	0.001268018385132106
Small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .	0.0019699874453982685
If they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .	0.003003084870198568
Also , in order to attain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .	0.005171139127784119
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations , but complementing them , never obstructing or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .	0.005173829636821812
Mr President , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .	0.00030989234048266505
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party .	14.196903245657253
Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements .	0.025678968055868872
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality .	8.858599898125826
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .	11.262998309510115
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .	8.780821935333899
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .	11.848868552475292
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine .	1.0194427639847918
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .	11.29185986533676
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future .	4.792940929075113
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .	7.250014853061014
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .	11.201303583567046
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and underspends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .	0.04862710821346296
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .	0.6101060386445117
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .	0.38852962314580647
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .	0.7376427921790607
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .	0.599165846521966
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU .	0.0146240649122474
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report .	0.0004072850922881914
She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .	6.529691550026687
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .	6.642860009488439
We are badly behind now in this matter .	12.201057429390925
Hopefully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation .	0.0009953614435384587
For the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated .	0.05929977252157445
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .	10.043210485663442
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .	0.6551157943911864
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes .	0.36909537044473023
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .	7.9537888812171005
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .	3.9668130720891708
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .	5.308779166020072
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .	6.293159439193777
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .	9.091934276783574
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .	0.34483553690636704
While the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union ' s regional policy in general .	0.20924190404758283
For us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .	0.002912504991534867
This report is very good and our Group supports it .	18.94194496994279
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission ' s offices for several months .	0.01372662013069989
Bearing this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that , before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved , they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament , specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today .	0.0007256774913859406
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe .	5.395454542391503
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .	0.017484914255369115
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .	11.63535237686185
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions .	9.000054560601258
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .	6.339634576640652
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .	8.810886779699738
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .	16.572347966593885
We will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .	0.08128794855869256
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament ' s plenary sitting today that Europe ' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .	5.9729311833869
This fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically .	0.10477538921649161
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .	0.7745343943174886
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .	0.0005290367029503912
We need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development , which have been drafted before the directives come into force , can be submitted for revision and proper assessment .	0.0172748403208845
We all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives .	0.03084676060929594
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .	0.01953817196921103
They need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .	0.3151365758295294
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .	13.686070671639845
I would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .	0.0029779908365320687
Mr President , I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .	0.1731041487669922
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .	8.667532252335405
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas .	5.322245730845506
This latter point is of particular importance .	19.155632442007924
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers .	5.922262437314105
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .	22.72033270542395
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .	0.08116364755883483
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session .	0.5715320143115122
Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .	0.03293899968128906
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .	7.796191694128767
This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions , the poorer regions in Europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .	0.0042179720727797895
In conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society .	0.10219762229366057
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions , financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy .	0.12093467948041593
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues .	0.1058707512736747
This time , however , I actually agree with her .	1.3834063383198158e-05
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I cannot say .	0.1296124590324965
Nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .	0.038219469798888246
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex , as we and Mrs McCarthy , as rapporteurs for the general regulation , had asked .	0.031804240071678404
Unfortunately , this did not happen .	0.002764539328280749
Mr Berni is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .	11.038506462755292
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position .	9.367628757027914
Thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far .	0.311788129817117
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .	0.004836826729839365
Personally , I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .	0.03734117436357894
As an islander , however , I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .	0.009412287978864238
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves .	10.72399557108311
This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament , and I have raised the issue time and time again .	0.40073221248436836
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .	0.0003084016626115389
Therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .	0.029111859789762974
The time has come to implement the programmes , and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .	0.25147855467132446
As for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May .	0.3346437166262721
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .	5.342699032954852
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Schroedter .	1.737378381804709e-05
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides , and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .	0.12293172856508738
I share the regrets she expressed , namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .	0.07385561760149134
Consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .	0.08707989591446406
In brief , I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .	0.09670445964708702
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .	11.268796664217877
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .	10.797530200853009
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?	0.09300139995710441
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .	0.0005736926900898367
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us .	9.28618927394052
Finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .	0.012138804468368842
As you know , it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation .	0.11350225834987984
Europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .	0.05053647159833248
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .	0.5222087510464135
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .	14.797492159166449
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .	0.08217408964019773
Mr President , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .	0.07377246116260204
As far as French planning experts are concerned , for example , the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country .	0.02015379589521438
Well , the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .	0.0716260355693621
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .	5.55247726168165
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .	7.2853973292344305
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level .	0.6705509098217403
The Commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .	0.00015904425005965913
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere .	12.6215624951211
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .	10.461071700951823
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it .	11.41093229001064
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .	0.01986762634141716
Over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .	0.001269160177308538
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .	0.0005834093341597794
For this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .	0.09077142581193742
For example , in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .	0.008570401807888204
There are , therefore , two points to which I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention .	0.0020556719923547234
Firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making , precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided .	0.1134099347738616
Secondly , a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent , since , they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated , to the point of hindering access to the Funds .	0.001991817860168958
This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses , in particular , tend to complain .	0.0014423988415628577
I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the failure of the Commission ' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and , especially , methods of combating unemployment among women and young people , is cause for serious concern .	0.0008033447715977626
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular .	0.0036146914448394007
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .	0.13231746946223197
The report itself is well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability .	0.03078009550225243
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .	0.10150200357448716
I would like to explain our thinking here .	33.95380254560585
Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .	0.09514282304528306
Past experience dictates that , as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money , hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money " indicators in the grant-giving process .	0.004277224401856202
Next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .	0.3970557609370544
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful .	6.577955342500852
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad .	0.7835844422552808
Finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .	0.20301582546705368
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .	7.213454406220999
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see .	0.0036268407851343175
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .	4.782653560685092
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today , I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up" .	0.22635863159364927
I urge the House to support these changes .	29.963804284318165
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work .	0.0005855006572580258
The European Union ' s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions .	0.0883089657684823
Despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment .	0.009044041100093509
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines .	7.067008583167092
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life .	0.214780486521272
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland .	1.1137434754702538
In closing , I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best .	0.12113303549213186
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and I would like to congratulate her on that .	0.006372133880479363
However , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community ' s regional policy .	0.4635044946176917
Quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravates it .	0.003917309495733531
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the South .	0.08879311933754376
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .	5.876723413260794
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .	0.2993088765950643
Little consideration , if any at all , has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure , transport , communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation .	0.0023134445982443824
The Union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .	9.480981808505824
A large section of the Union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots .	8.469076703126277
Unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .	0.44300025384279484
Mr President , I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union .	0.30719908081181824
The first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .	0.25673632333996255
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously .	13.003273785573008
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union ' s fundamental objectives .	13.180140318094113
Secondly , I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .	0.6482229117951818
In future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the Azores and Madeira .	0.0026577749989636903
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission ' s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awaited by Parliament ?	0.43433816339719916
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .	0.012222576185524735
Mr President , Commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .	0.006494618552243851
However , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .	0.10508104453459982
Nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .	0.08749580491189347
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration , and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive , small and medium-sized enterprises , on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing , and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields .	0.07734910439587897
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .	0.5166551918879595
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations .	0.018357057981266613
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women .	0.04369467599715045
Unfortunately , the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe ' s most highly-developed regions .	0.04100932001699887
They are growing , but only in terms of GDP .	0.02523819010285296
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .	6.743826849149649
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens ' greatest problem .	0.05617643990116252
Please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .	0.0002825409790204874
Mr President , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .	0.05671200091549156
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which , of course , comprise half of the islands of the Union , as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty .	0.006422893915534126
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .	5.9641813508829795
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments , occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter ' s report .	0.01627590391361587
Everyone understands , Mrs Schroedter , ladies and gentlemen , the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays , since we are discussing this report right now , as the representative for the Commission , I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming .	0.012011130106303053
Mrs Schroedter , you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters , European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires , and is the justification for , a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out .	0.07137186385471662
So , ladies and gentlemen , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , Mrs Schroedter , and the various Members of this House , have made .	0.000710186452852907
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , Mr Hatzidakis , Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds .	0.06303200736303212
This means putting forward the Commission ' s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations .	0.038321063608835755
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of Community involvement , including , Mr Bradbourn , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies .	0.00019903716585844137
When I speak of optimum utilisation , I am referring both to the national and regional levels .	0.19533062548377528
And so , Mr Seppnen , I shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund .	5.9559391603557257e-05
This is the purpose of these guidelines .	28.11271969933091
Regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this House , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as I understood her presentation just now .	0.00026651801706670903
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as Mr Berend said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales .	0.0
And , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission , let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .	0.0006379899837681693
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro , who asked me about this , that , as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions , the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .	0.005853784664253381
Concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .	0.00578351641563673
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .	6.802642625786801
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and , within the College , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions .	0.2849894359159461
I would thank you for your understanding in this matter .	13.445462383587802
So that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .	0.04549201989218339
The second priority , which several of you have stressed , Mr Puerta in particular , but there were others , not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .	0.002143797893104703
Ladies and gentlemen , we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great , proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund , but where , at the same time , in relation to unemployment - as you wrote , Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions .	0.006610829134179183
This is a situation which is , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable .	0.0009054841109069719
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social , human and territorial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe , a Europe of wealthy districts but , at the same time , a Europe of impoverished areas .	0.009908909916051154
The third objective is urban and rural development , within the scope of a balanced territorial policy .	0.1081577065898644
In fact , the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account .	0.00439363464217563
The first is rural development , and let me say , Mrs Schroedter , that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time .	0.0022888448901711173
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country .	8.343557151149293
The second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union .	0.05428737397208772
Finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House , particularly yourself , Mrs Schroedter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or redevelopment , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership .	0.0002433423961840679
You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .	0.49457530119434623
However , I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that , as far as I am concerned , this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool , one used to involve local brainpower , be it in the public sector , in the form of elected representatives , the social and educational sectors , associations , or in the private sector ; a decentralised partnership , and let me mention in this connection , in response to Mrs Angelilli , the territorial pacts , which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership .	0.0
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions .	0.035414278897585
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .	0.016271254571322485
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date .	8.676017165840912
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February 1999 , in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text , my predecessor , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , presented them to Parliament immediately .	0.002878683661920351
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time , however , Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted , in July 1999 .	0.017699454839375912
Here in this Chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .	0.017415928563314784
And let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this House , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .	0.0007913419069249151
Now to the form .	82.37917854021092
On the subject of the role of the guidelines , Mrs Schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .	0.0029843065020838666
I shall not list them all , but they include implementing intersectoral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc .	0.0028385858363310064
The Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document .	0.0828509993433485
Drawing to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , Mrs Schroedter .	0.006290290798653233
I am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .	0.0024806189921048258
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .	9.351597848386033
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations , which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad , indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies .	0.14742812035489467
I actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks .	0.03630663625172034
Moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .	0.43286128488590636
You then mentioned , Mrs Schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .	0.0032906419776084755
I find the opposite the case .	26.72797053698202
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .	0.010615574202679933
Indeed , I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .	0.3044311529424755
As regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly Mrs Redondo Jimnez , the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and Europe ' s rural heritage .	0.0060762831391895766
It must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds , whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .	0.005284669910623301
And indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section , aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture .	0.025614310282352993
At this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions .	0.08958508574993734
In any event , I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .	0.1292991001993009
Before concluding , I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France , Austria and Germany , in particular , in the last few weeks , and at the same time we shall once again be discussing , together with my fellow Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio , what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France .	0.0027294772938503318
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , sir , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2 .	0.0003722565807742967
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .	0.028853286351213942
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms .	0.23764259952131472
Indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms .	0.4036451476443405
In conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines .	0.0002806493885475282
We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view .	9.551671209460102
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes .	0.7177036532513223
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes .	7.886313760398555
I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions , at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken , good joint working practice , which is , Mr Hatzidakis , backed up by something I am very attentive to : observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions .	0.0016067372671001686
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999 ) by Mr Berend , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)] .	0.03228656453888579
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report .	0.12833368507290951
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches .	0.0031919561230293837
The Commission report generally relativises this observation , particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French overseas departments and , more generally , the most remote regions .	0.0097163951647417
In this respect , I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.056252041538109435
Finally , in my view , this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions .	0.03927662870636895
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union ' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC .	1.1040734984387461
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author , both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility , which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee .	0.04034445270961474
It must be remembered that , currently , the European Union ' s overall competitiveness is , in general terms , 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units , that is the regions , also improves .	0.0008837238446028422
Furthermore , this is at a time when technological development , economic globalisation and our problems , which are enlargement and the single currency , demand that the regions , as well as businesses and individuals , make more of an effort to be competitive .	0.0003530280842038486
The European Commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .	17.959703135429894
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .	0.08944564718932077
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .	0.13006194164921117
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions ' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .	4.966014118094578
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .	9.384238847265868
This , Commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period .	0.0002425454118779204
Thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006 .	0.00537041830954397
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .	0.030270890476030404
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union ' s regional policy aims .	10.358716665584325
The report shows that growth has been uneven , despite all our efforts .	0.0640532231225984
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe .	17.55399143945202
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average , whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .	0.3704476221930142
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .	5.662438406094054
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences , long distances , climates that are too cold or too hot , sparse populations and austere conditions ?	0.004893203395031297
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?	3.2813865467113286
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union ' s more remote areas .	7.707654770408943
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .	22.43243721622899
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased .	6.453394656816772
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .	10.55621745466434
In the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .	0.19413308153249836
For example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .	0.01386153167613058
In this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development .	0.015399982463624375
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how .	8.651027811251652
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report .	17.948836058133757
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union ' s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes .	2.5713393513884482e-05
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23.7% in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4% .	0.0009088878577695964
Given this situation , the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment : measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes , which are often misspent , with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems , with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks , which are due in 2007 .	0.01085444352139376
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries ' agriculture and fisheries , which are often harmed by the European Union ' s own insensitive policies , as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs , particularly for women and young people .	0.06273230314200598
Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality , which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects .	0.7223470211542982
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .	0.04986782338408841
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .	0.005755614563107964
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified .	24.933686780428932
I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report .	8.782722458833721
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region , that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises .	0.0532485422351492
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions , that is to say job creation measures , special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business .	0.12004502542292016
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities .	14.190492677820144
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions .	0.739341428340582
After all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .	0.311504255978863
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer .	9.362173335072441
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .	0.011376348128665914
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .	4.858930471207443
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .	10.146473328557056
In other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .	0.29222230541599237
For example , these would be measures for vocational training , for further education , for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process , for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again .	0.011168511094728752
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .	0.013777865086337271
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union .	4.9793396590259755
By stimulating a diversity of investments , the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment .	0.2436300096159202
From the sixth periodic report on the regions , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .	0.2797204065283369
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .	0.0436201981676441
As indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .	0.0014311525378761772
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for .	10.616722584335786
Also , the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions .	0.2115240778121938
Mr President , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boosting employment .	0.008334973438775001
It is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .	0.001012996820526567
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .	0.0024167342307766806
Surely this must be the ultimate goal .	28.302884546175086
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions .	10.024319447836994
Following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give Member States more say anyway .	0.002930794968441478
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .	0.17146880202550582
Finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries .	0.1907987495019103
The report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind EU countries , especially in terms of GDP per capita .	0.0005500365021666645
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .	0.3508076736469749
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .	7.483296155503618
Mr President , Commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .	0.029105692673148522
For example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .	0.024822571239145882
Equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .	0.00857958700067143
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .	17.315096732069858
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .	6.3991595889147534
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training .	0.4230813889657516
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .	7.3848449617373495
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed .	0.5734357064897443
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .	7.764631578371903
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .	0.027846876872189813
This issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .	0.0020667577012113327
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided , I would say quite magnificently , the development of poor countries .	0.015514488219940623
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago .	5.5311099163828
In this connection , French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau " : in other words , I take my hat off to the EU .	0.0018943336641256902
The EU really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .	0.228023825893619
What is the result ?	1.9186083663385756
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust .	7.656057061963743
Consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .	0.0015415524921221168
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .	12.16574703552456
Most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .	0.00027079922268247907
We must give them this opportunity .	28.172966603861894
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .	19.947791405426262
The solution , as I see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .	0.0001339142204234096
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .	0.12777399460983271
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .	0.03818164241144573
What is a fair society ?	1.6983807932038832
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .	5.596378859419175
In this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .	0.028595587817586688
Finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy , as it often is here in Europe .	0.03327506928553956
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .	4.2354798307560866e-05
Firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union .	0.00983116929916556
The most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .	0.0032065725327708725
In Reunion , for example , the rate is 37% .	5.625903528230979e-06
This is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality .	4.469109760440482e-05
The principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .	0.464382799629853
It only remains to put this principle into practice .	15.602049800452576
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January , then February , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism .	0.022460336012309488
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .	7.334607726468891
As regards taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .	0.0036017597821993907
If these do not materialise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us , and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the size of the amounts committed , will end in failure .	0.0007045174300020424
Mr President , as all the previous speakers have done , I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report .	0.015571291427028342
Just like the previous report , this extremely competent and precise analysis , the recommendations it supports and your own comments , ladies and gentlemen , shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006 .	0.02707361244044769
I should also like to make a few comments , firstly , Mr Berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .	0.0011387094590025464
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote , if I am not mistaken , that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports .	0.05576747802480884
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself .	0.09425518329943035
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure , Mr Berend , that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you .	0.07140502690812867
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report , where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported , improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov , just now , and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully .	0.01003227925996398
I am thinking of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resources potential , small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad .	0.0029970437201195382
So much for the quality .	42.31886013500472
I do not wish to spend time right now , Mr Berend , going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed .	0.03331449134309863
Let me just itemise them : the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy , particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States .	0.10399923242217185
Secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stressed , the role of local and regional authorities , the private sector , both sides of industry , associations and local community action groups .	5.603205950252218e-05
Regarding this problem of partnership , I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly .	0.3306368844252993
Thirdly , the need to develop the employment side of growth , even though I am aware , as Mr van Dam just said , that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States , and that , when we speak of the responsibility of Member States , and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy , we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in .	0.000768006641710193
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably .	12.263241743139387
Mr Fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there is growth , and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession , as has been the case in the past .	0.0063334283452629635
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .	7.9746716782472395
I agree with your analysis .	85.85301479900996
When there is growth , it must be better distributed , but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island regions , is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades .	0.013273971118077687
Fourthly , a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now , the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people .	0.013617738006099675
Fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses .	0.02579223804288623
Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now .	16.127912964757634
Finally , the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds , the motives of officials in managing these funds , even if it is occasionally complicated , and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation , follow-up and supervision of the Commission .	0.004473742639664812
In relation to this , I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds .	0.8352857022182232
I should like to mention a few specific points .	21.267266479994174
Mr Berend , you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly .	0.013898573944878888
Well , we are coming to an end of the zoning phase .	0.06236640067929552
Tomorrow , the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon , I hope , it will be Italy ' s turn .	0.0018144456973126321
You may therefore be satisfied on this point , since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2 .	0.28088852916471346
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report , I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and , as Mr Cocilovo mentioned , there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data .	0.04072687501316106
To a certain extent , they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and , in any case , I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics .	0.04401342442963565
Mr Berend , you also mentioned , as did Mr Aparicio Snchez , the lack of reform in the fisheries sector .	0.0001835338980608517
On this point which is of personal interest to me , let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context .	1.297249791886719
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries , under Commissioner Fischler .	0.2372885405195029
Nonetheless , I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concerns .	0.012240525773316795
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mentioned some of these .	0.22737165690905756
I wish to assure you , firstly , that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is , as far as I am concerned , Mr Berend , an extremely important instrument , not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner , so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated , but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and , furthermore , with the elected representatives , i.e . yourselves , on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy .	0.0
In any event , I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report : the definition , compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe ; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned , particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau ; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .	0.012805469659026717
This will constitute a great challenge to us all , for you and for the Commission , in the next few years .	0.004473570848403167
And finally , there are the cross-border aspects .	0.0007589319630346782
I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points .	11.60139847281398
Finally , I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are , in any case , familiar with , but whose main elements I should like to reiterate .	0.0004112443445040854
Ladies and gentlemen , considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence , particularly for the four cohesion countries , but also frankly , Mr Pohjamo , for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development , especially regarding infrastructure .	0.0006433659659116118
This is my first point regarding the policy .	14.040159536943586
My second point regarding the policy is as follows : the Structural Funds have made , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .	0.0026926513815035222
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that , over the last decade , more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds .	0.09935529600209085
I have , however , taken note , particularly with regard to the most remote regions , Mrs Sudre , Mr Fruteau , and Mr Nogueira Romn too , that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects , the fight against social exclusion , which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions , and the integration of women and young people into the labour market .	0.0
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy ; enlargement of the Union , the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions , the major challenge , too , for the European policy on cohesion , a point which Mr van Dam highlighted .	0.0004086604808262453
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us .	6.635172244620733
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument , which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks .	0.2747216990607147
You see , ladies and gentlemen , we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union ' s enlargement on our structural policy .	0.028443478758536322
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole , Mr Berend , is a good basis for our thinking , for us all and for myself .	0.0025642788750124285
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines , as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006 .	1.1391732060183002
Thank you very much , Commissioner .	0.0010244419272122105
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . (The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m. ) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .	0.0030757661484872205
Are there any comments ?	1.0899764773977065
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes .	0.25855200933932115
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .	12.066247966692217
Firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated .	1.0059114052889024
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .	5.865905809616184
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers remarked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission .	0.21098001586860193
We should also have the humility to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five-year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were .	0.06546174461476206
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this .	14.053268980787685
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .	0.5728708390340546
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission .	5.5504108040501805
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships .	5.784199054906558
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly .	0.5865893418294738
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation .	27.911222524093084
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .	4.843613545745521
It should not be dramatised into something more than that .	14.639861438025715
Thank you very much , Mr Cox .	0.0012240460201337366
I understand what you are saying .	30.214287366415025
We have taken note of this .	19.975938145608872
Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda .	0.01220621530641384
However , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .	0.18711756777064775
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda .	22.42756613283838
Mr Wynn , that makes sense .	0.00022222295621900104
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .	14.200181572680755
Mr President , regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower .	0.07183220617512318
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .	12.03006388947932
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .	0.2499926220230742
Mrs Ahern , we have taken note of this .	0.0012067462529763357
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor , to the attention of the Quaestors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .	0.00020072754486696623
We will also pass this on to our services , however .	0.02800375167196904
Thank you very much .	31.167929532936945
(The Minutes were approved ) Reform of European competition policy The next item is the joint debate on the following reports : A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999 ) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)] ; A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the European Commission ' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999 ) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)] ; A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors .	0.016088244185593705
[COM(1999 ) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS) ] (Report 1995-1997) ; A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No . 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) .	0.01840068160429646
[COM(1999 ) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)] .	27.267996213636646
Mr President , Commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union ' s competition policy .	0.002955518767555304
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law , that is Mr von Wogau ' s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe .	0.11458847086948316
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation " to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step " .	1.5744274530237559
However , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .	0.0351912258109551
But , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .	0.002796560928798932
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy .	10.017622897731338
On reading both Commission documents , one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .	0.09866624185628883
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture .	17.627502608964004
As the competent authority , the Commission , with its logically consistent approach , has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned .	0.0017173914523511578
It should continue along this path .	28.721090592936136
But , Commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .	0.0006275478467206714
Indeed , it is not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned .	0.01135503535792166
Only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .	0.006990535252788545
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .	0.015083372180001829
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there is one point that I would just like to go into now .	0.044141146977538064
Transparency and accountability belong together .	47.18707116702625
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question .	11.709785293312915
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?	0.02291260667068513
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .	0.12921482021652492
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though .	17.661356189945256
Parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous .	0.00809191129927252
Therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .	0.2575293151891969
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases , even given the Treaty status quo .	0.3423789533980424
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .	7.561535005097636
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .	10.871967204514771
With all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .	0.00019612693111900416
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .	15.10642979076197
At the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue .	0.5463702051102797
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .	5.9789013827887025
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .	12.643261442814737
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .	0.1577696674960046
But on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .	0.009357773443729766
Competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .	0.008959682381881395
However , since state aid forms the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jonckheer ' s report , to say one more thing about it .	0.008993777505277358
It is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy .	0.816585693217995
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .	0.39086556459964117
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .	7.521290236831464
It is not just that we should pillory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives .	1.0665061102827686
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party .	6.212162626755629
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission ' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .	0.017963908022200825
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various typologies , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .	0.10017779333941118
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid , on average , for the period under review , is in the order of EUR 95 billion , corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995 , a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany .	0.028131252245024926
To put it plainly , the level of state aid declared , roughly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent , coincidentally , of the Community budget for one year .	0.0011064225008164347
This being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage earner .	0.00013993101991431858
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be assimilated in some way into state aid .	0.31518468413656514
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .	0.03353790066537062
This being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .	0.12079062608494483
We note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the Commission ' s annual report , to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty .	0.003643366527411639
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States .	5.905366457079643
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .	0.4950557965615808
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet .	0.038612439599142456
Having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .	0.05011359919571305
And insofar as such studies already exist , to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties , which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .	0.031372034034270205
By stressing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .	0.00090263945980634
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and , on the other hand , acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty , particularly , as I have said already , as regards sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .	0.0014970103557563161
This being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur ' s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results .	0.18520309554758435
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .	16.678609225446
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the inadequacies , acknowledged or not , of private investment alone , the market failures or inadequacies of the market .	0.005833998038609296
There is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important .	6.402743852551283e-05
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stressing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .	3.422498661803997e-05
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .	0.22059347773277288
This is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all probability , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .	0.010094080160799117
And finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.0005392899998675317
As you know , Commissioner , our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .	0.012944859123698393
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission .	0.006037312297277944
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these .	8.505090436210223
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly .	23.801139247100267
Hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .	0.33429001325280655
The European Commission ' s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the European Parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty .	0.004010512555873862
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament .	0.5404334556937471
As in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1 ) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .	0.40030254015676714
According to this article , state aid is irreconcilable with the common market , in principle .	0.001032440262002898
Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .	19.592417743838524
Under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid .	0.03006258787005179
In 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany .	0.07267641336540008
Furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .	0.20684432457778254
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .	9.355916410126907
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , precisely-defined cases i.e . those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether .	0.0040441006613627165
In addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .	0.026207843320908045
However , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .	0.44551640397777964
As far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .	0.688092140328779
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .	8.752133970779262
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe .	11.007282603540958
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years .	0.36945960680420836
Consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations .	0.13106057830983162
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind .	7.613492018647397
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission ' s supervision .	0.9796891717992617
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .	0.10825757296390066
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .	7.498084768625991
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .	8.952828499575862
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .	8.550822100502755
We also need to criticise the Commission ' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned .	0.2594688414851537
The Commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .	0.05212107036201131
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .	0.017717176777461624
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .	0.00014231273741051583
Subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike .	0.08248846296181422
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .	0.1822169804613931
Subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .	0.01814838829198256
A successive phasing out of State aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition .	0.16456198878001452
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .	0.13578433240824134
Public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .	0.0006193022729673466
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the spheres of education , health care and social services .	0.05655855330880879
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .	22.50577205924388
Europe must be modernised , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .	0.36700569775250724
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living .	10.888794266984316
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently .	11.103011990901923
In fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .	0.0038009474033708604
The internal market is the basis for our work .	21.924035542202542
Its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .	0.07216073302995334
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled .	9.478321528914725
The EU ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .	16.516455423068614
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .	5.901393528317092
In order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the Member States ' national authorities .	0.1607897848747214
In six months ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the Commission ' s role .	0.685019823155527
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .	4.6891087642998
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed .	9.109259598140072
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .	8.805385349428587
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .	11.010631399074795
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .	0.391356669776971
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us .	13.581706475754313
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .	0.3101127328586269
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .	6.541758665115607
In fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .	0.0450183165500083
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay .	6.2539545882421255
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .	6.534948618168608
Mr President , as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .	0.017152329436114677
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .	0.0005868351181760572
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service .	0.10488089701061504
All this is to the good of the consumer .	20.172461644056465
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .	11.757869230664266
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .	0.41239112123106847
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .	0.12558793488970887
At the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .	0.011881302460308924
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters .	0.027174932595803804
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape .	7.175592191162473
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .	15.863609105234362
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts .	0.004661021933718395
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .	0.5665220297985115
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter .	5.512247733903621
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .	0.22625062017535735
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .	14.273123758139407
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined .	1.0411727499814523
However , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .	0.009991602729165005
One is subsidiarity .	191.93154808051537
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions .	0.46969606572286127
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .	5.549097483327184
I would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and Gtesiegel .	0.00010927753721510152
Here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .	0.0003010066273351584
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .	17.572157622597807
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .	15.238084917033527
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .	6.137651092339223
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I am not going to talk about market failure just now .	0.35030104154806135
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters .	0.5566622961053563
These days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field .	0.06697741701840636
However , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evolved structures , stifle competition .	0.0029073005720077843
Apart from that , I could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .	0.00014145448061126458
To conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity .	0.019372753850973767
I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across - the-board regulation by Europe .	0.9651360316647074
Thank you very much , Mr Radwan .	0.0013322797433139037
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak , inappropriately in your case , as a maiden speech .	0.023623328724909944
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .	0.00018094976023905405
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .	0.2771420024865511
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .	10.507667673910403
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .	0.4831521432226664
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .	4.683165055799839
While , since the dawn of time , the market has been the key forum for human interchange , it has never been perfect .	0.0013659785342546487
The market favours the short term and immediate profits .	19.95704918437342
On the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .	0.018930015282846532
In order to function , the market needs rules .	0.02083579753883768
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .	7.637684457229301
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .	12.615856181302933
The market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .	0.14474010855535935
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .	0.5686558948855738
Finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know-how .	4.264078961952952e-05
The main objective of the Union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .	7.984044344853368
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .	0.00884307869078806
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .	5.881964050017984
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .	16.69185381034722
The Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .	0.20055486595415473
The World Wide Web , which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society , was developed by CERN in Geneva , once again with public aid .	0.0035695443046141057
The German Government ' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .	5.299902188663554
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .	0.35206980015307143
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund , LTCM .	0.24074446967137303
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a sin against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .	0.008243619079157435
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil .	0.02700080939039046
Human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .	0.0009702744522045027
We Socialists reject the liberals ' nave optimism on this point .	8.145161924882213
We want a true culture of competition in Europe .	14.901828496756277
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge .	9.905503865222897
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .	0.002421683159793623
I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .	0.0007794936721704438
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments .	7.036148434900039
These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless .	0.19027778953723007
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen : Holzmann , a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government ; sawmills in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .	4.9478276830744095e-05
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .	6.009592313630771
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .	0.19285851904984413
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .	0.011635238472439031
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .	0.38773029324853603
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .	0.3698276634666695
As I say , our amendments concern transparency , and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be .	0.059761077131867964
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .	15.164308288945275
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?	2.3520920291625123
At present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment .	0.015141710566418266
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .	10.814581131397532
Finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .	0.013016792027321644
You have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard .	0.0006246694343783203
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .	9.032808369902906
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendments , and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .	0.0034215444693762266
To conclude , I want to welcome the Commission ' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .	0.000149781964171502
But , as I have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .	0.006633603415548717
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .	0.7998494676243378
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .	0.024230071675061665
As Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .	0.02326450861974618
Mr President , Commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .	0.0002195540414708775
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?	0.13750846682032078
Regarding the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed , it is essential that , in some instances , there is state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemptions , special taxation or even direct aid .	0.0010801895154971366
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .	0.6225519748970881
So our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .	0.004866064247654643
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .	8.797101067348171
We feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything .	0.4170827841049507
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .	6.03500440930154
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union ' s competition policy .	0.02610274460154688
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .	6.819309662891938
The overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups .	5.439299229818924
Should we not be discussing this issue ?	1.5422098078320503
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies .	8.70289805581147
Certain sectors of European industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremendously .	0.0009382861777967932
They have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .	0.3457416826640374
When will we debate that ?	1.4142130957080048
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that .	0.42487920050551514
And yet , we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid .	0.2539334075357588
At the same time , unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .	0.15340838165787052
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .	9.56101450455297
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business .	0.2779217433276718
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .	8.882877552873602
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .	0.0013960512600742691
The competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .	0.0022648446692013183
For our part , we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which , far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency , imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket , which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe .	0.00608091735524236
Having said that , governing means planning .	0.00830212492903048
It also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .	0.026062380335805775
In this area , the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices , by refocusing its departments ' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law .	0.05277969235290245
As regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be recorded , does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints .	0.017260048498250368
Finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .	0.04568058581809068
The Commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all .	0.011225808065054086
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .	8.605979179026383
In conclusion , I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states .	0.007497712654263676
Mr President , Commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the Commission ' s White Paper on competition , particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we are also puzzled by several things .	0.0031167702901192156
First of all , there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers , though necessary in many ways , will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives , and that some people will be tempted to use competition law , not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails , of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets , but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy , planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves , or even for protectionist purposes .	0.0030750165613332757
In this respect , we should heed the words of von Eieck , and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni , who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies .	0.018130697163970106
State interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers .	0.008565323743345715
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone ' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann .	0.15502891732294502
Finally , Commissioner , we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the Post Office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option .	0.0015688009715614233
Commissioner , I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties , but I believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .	0.014987193384758596
What is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .	0.11740227018368554
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .	2.4751819018431397e-05
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .	8.538937044524971
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .	8.813965945351066
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views .	9.333925486797725
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .	0.0008317002107220786
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless .	0.35115922850977205
Firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .	0.08880051110366474
In general , I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .	0.06089795146939132
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .	0.011506173837143188
It is true , there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way .	0.06027502682649453
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .	8.676475050738652
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .	5.80718029345326
So , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible .	0.7029558292828872
Secondly , I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .	0.031272039798032
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .	12.642291264833204
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future .	12.24266864215445
In the White Paper , you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?	0.05051737009468975
Thirdly , I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .	0.2783926209189133
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case , one has got to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector .	0.018160275802355193
Fourthly , I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .	0.5416997227485741
Fifthly , with the pending enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .	0.008977253247430194
They are still in training , as it were .	0.012645953700598152
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market ?	2.285570302623128
Sixthly and lastly , I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .	0.051258060949789644
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .	0.6522618669201541
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege ?	2.17600888367408
Commissioner , I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that , in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit .	0.019050466373854175
Mr President , I would like , in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau .	1.9779980918407385e-05
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .	5.925791111290439
We are , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper .	1.6754952143040917e-05
Since the Treaty entered into force , Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy .	0.18956217501156597
After almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion .	0.14241135632349186
For this reason , modernisation was essential .	0.007358815200383371
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons .	14.67816079544055
Firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .	3.935955581137119e-08
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .	0.008723059758781163
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .	5.833721054390435
A system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or prohibitions , is something less than a valid system .	0.0003802192077319061
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1 ) and 82 for some time .	7.603183956997638
However , they could not apply Article 81(3) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1) .	5.855311193008846e-05
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice , both brought by German courts , which question the feasibility of applying 81(1 ) without being able to apply 81(3) .	0.07747612306315847
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary .	15.510779493998703
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762 .	10.969624626585517
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .	22.895549611618723
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure , that it did not establish time limits , that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files , or that the right to defence was not properly recognised , were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform .	0.016746638229719522
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994 , the Commission published a communication on this subject .	0.5570032268896111
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .	17.73991674946574
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape .	10.672457498941915
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .	0.4475538522060558
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .	18.23409542464262
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .	10.040490336328405
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .	6.349086092237311
Amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82 , Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight .	0.00011837851816568034
At the moment , with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them , the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important .	0.032306269770813315
Secondly , Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .	0.09821803400622162
For these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .	0.04200900375286022
However , if some of the amendments are accepted , particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group , we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document , lacking in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support .	0.0011665815819261812
Mr President , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the Commission ' s White Paper .	0.0013764350655875088
Frankly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .	0.0315270439654494
Through his management , Commissioner Monti achieves good results , as did his predecessor and , clearly , he has established a guarantee which , in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market , has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately , without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged , as has happened in the European Union since 1993 .	0.003889375642645684
If it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the Commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?	0.00042793514135176493
Various arguments have been presented in its favour .	26.9219774518377
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis , justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States , are truly identical in all regions .	0.0501319409435921
Because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market .	0.06246499963096382
In that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the Union .	0.013325634210014375
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union , when compared to previous reports .	0.038067297158423226
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Rapkay , who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way .	0.030389825106327133
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country , which I represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .	0.11692547684770647
Nevertheless , I cannot forget the numerous criticisms , both from Member States and from market operators , which , given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases , maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment , the planning of company mergers etc .	0.019221676390886115
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .	0.0032170575510175863
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .	0.0005372698157415364
Mr President , I would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .	0.09511466924299788
From the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .	0.020620398026744962
This is why I give this report my full support .	17.49700974467611
Recently , I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .	0.026189500213230528
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for Europe ' s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general .	0.0017847300473664053
Mr President , for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union .	0.18062266866457014
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .	6.021807418754786
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete .	19.56718282585195
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament , I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project .	0.40329169552131017
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe .	15.234027331324025
But all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market .	0.005608174361550193
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals .	21.157433975293763
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti .	10.387192742652644
We look to him as the man to root out cartels .	13.578461157356275
But he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .	0.012696896421945936
That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mr von Wogau .	0.23572716385079026
I want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side ! He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .	0.3203522184306631
So although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address .	0.4452885242544963
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .	11.09125916862056
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists .	0.08527193692267494
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .	8.263876501174199
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .	16.20893923350026
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .	7.8422680645834255
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court .	14.847621033546869
Well , we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment .	0.06738950524534776
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission .	0.6024863046734595
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point , in the Factortame case , in which the British Government was the defendant , it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling .	0.016847196680109016
So , judicially , something needs to be done .	5.48948393402266e-05
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .	12.342906494536024
In relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen .	0.07491934479141049
It is important that business has legal certainty .	18.451918877392814
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently .	20.99863594884347
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .	14.570043487753246
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom .	5.896755593453869
We all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .	0.0007647079308727545
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy .	0.6370595846722279
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change .	12.949397942045783
We have been told how , currently , people's time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .	8.658768740798553e-05
But I really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .	0.006673739333371866
Finally , we , as British Conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .	0.00011807638951376931
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that .	13.331662026823885
Mr President , the European Union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began .	0.051707211661326684
It is an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of European integration , between solidarity and cooperation between Member States , with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity .	0.010058837803841173
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .	13.929956638161793
We can be proud of a European competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .	0.29217994871764646
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .	18.655469750858213
However , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits .	0.018710664392790035
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror .	0.9133990364876351
Society is surrendering itself to the economy .	16.58054686030261
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union .	8.060086466633848
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .	0.10935108381797619
European competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .	0.00014357149586716013
In common with the other Members , I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .	0.1953513482166701
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken .	12.13498988130344
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .	9.794725964149821
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .	0.08926840344673369
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .	7.276241931621033
Then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy , and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .	0.003068654786072718
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement .	10.160155706029917
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis .	5.0406177508610925
At the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives .	0.04175320612547058
A word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .	0.18496630556683083
I am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation .	0.00917021087774622
The system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .	0.015301178037539675
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .	9.398654221419946
Indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty .	0.11869955236526294
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .	0.15094573610821455
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .	5.871724851668427
For example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990 .	0.028229609995348525
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .	0.05519320003756285
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .	4.044301588807463
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that .	0.36690006755355636
Mr President , in the limited time I have , I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by Mr Jonckheer , who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid .	0.027771497771516832
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .	0.6132644407740545
As a Member for the Basque Country , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .	0.3326887762736768
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general , and Mr Monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid .	0.036484949092377233
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature , foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union , and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who , by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law , are subject to those rules .	0.07839310537158901
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .	2.4484115457741388e-05
We need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth-running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally-friendly products .	0.0005136656901937209
In other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .	0.27102033689203947
I often have the impression , unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics .	0.05469886537888459
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .	7.85686975264341
But a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .	0.14169632409640553
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the Grnitz steelworks in Brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .	0.0370986554509176
But these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany .	0.22511990701702742
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .	0.015302877995878084
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .	9.28087653715543
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics .	7.391706349012733
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power .	6.040715953649994
To that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .	0.338255121434978
Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today .	0.3149943310523441
I would like to quote verbatim from the report : "State aid per capita is highest in Italy , Germany and Ireland .	0.014180999711956176
Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together. " I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .	0.8385848491867555
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .	8.446200881024204
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .	11.236407751154553
This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe .	11.399386787738464
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .	10.31824352137327
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000 .	5.041269144093704
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace .	4.902150237600838
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage .	22.364071695474912
Mr President , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe .	0.031052229736027694
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with .	0.2986206333018911
But opinion differs as to the solution .	23.415265963278316
The Commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .	4.994513502788232
In other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .	0.17531434954677055
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system .	8.283000835280417
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .	9.133099479195542
We would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable .	0.2036727288356032
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .	25.36804183231065
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow .	0.6135707426191668
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future .	0.013064755239528636
This is unacceptable to my mind .	24.922134038806984
The Commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States ' courts .	12.644215231574728
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy .	7.112300786705684
This is unacceptable in my view .	23.690492759565668
It would weaken a key element of European policy .	12.32861958654745
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .	7.5947744762939955
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .	7.884568616393218
In any case , the Commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties .	0.2637199127136725
There was no majority for this at the time .	11.893165911010087
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .	0.19805781026149735
Forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of Europe ' s consumers .	0.08552880354276299
I consider this to be unacceptable .	31.442822673995902
Mr President , in this important debate on competition , I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen ' s document on the Steel Aid Code .	0.013828735268674694
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances .	0.16029216697402415
Indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector .	0.027994433184263198
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses , even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty .	0.7814982374862393
This indeed , is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code , but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .	0.017199484564777903
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .	0.011651499485240097
In the same category of ideas , it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .	0.4792278097616083
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines .	57.521674561046034
I agree with this request .	90.95918939391187
Like the rapporteur , while I am pleased with the Commission report , nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .	0.03854745610563362
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code .	0.43335877099544146
In the interests of equality , either the Code must be applied or it must be modified .	0.15611390478252982
Finally , and in conclusion , Mr President , with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty , the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area .	0.004428964012838268
We therefore await , and I await , the European Commission ' s proposals on this matter .	0.002273854893196293
Mr President , I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .	0.00583759968299975
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues .	29.078603388714257
Firstly , I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .	0.0051728540212615534
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code , the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code .	0.10197761919580449
However , the thing that worries us most , Mr President , is the decrease in prices , by 30% , owing to imports .	4.865679642667887e-06
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .	0.043677114569774356
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .	0.4113500316252823
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems : Asturias .	0.11697803155908845
With global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .	0.052444961109383736
I know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it .	0.003984537973108303
Mr President , Commissioner , Director-General , I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report : I welcome the Commission ' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .	0.001170445957496933
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .	0.03239797619408061
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the Member States , and above all the SMEs concerned , that need to be clarified .	0.0018875498557304642
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy .	6.246599028918461
However , it must be "europeanised " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .	0.0740003945114697
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility .	0.0014046336938020704
In practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished , non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related , staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement To conclude , I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform : fair competition and equal competition conditions , legal certainty for all enterprises , consistent application of competition policy , procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop , coordination of the national - and to me , independent - competition authorities , close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission , along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law , and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies .	0.0
I am in suspense as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .	0.01706131165285104
The Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .	0.0035030989686321156
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .	7.192346369790016
As far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .	0.313082484224646
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .	9.589663701130585
Take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period .	0.00137844068065721
With what aim ?	1.0
Not to save jobs .	79.91383308381735
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .	10.207713657681667
Not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .	0.0057585673909403435
Did these firms need state aid to survive ?	1.8982321995055091
No , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .	0.05368807282790698
State aid is not only counterproductive because , as the Jonckheer report acknowledges , it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders .	0.03950404166862545
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .	0.05942529232802972
In voting against the Jonckheer report , I wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff .	0.015779352987378332
Mr President , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .	0.11516857566137065
In accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .	0.013087456263610952
Firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to Commissioner Monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .	0.00047691818979428137
This has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .	0.054375535386945666
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .	12.821549238002323
Firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .	0.00013185717371647475
It is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts .	0.005791360456016175
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .	6.091864227962401
Thirdly , it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .	0.10871044239947482
Fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .	0.19620886302355034
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .	5.8755223761757325
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application .	14.570045799759194
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards , employment standards , in order to prevent dumping in this area , and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid , which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory .	0.013608242898843664
To sum up , we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid , internal distortions by other countries , from being transferred to the international arena , in other words , through trickery .	0.00020636978567541394
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .	0.008777105042862148
First of all the report reveals Parliament ' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly .	12.034174554992541
Many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .	0.00028850441620033545
For example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this .	0.26393613980014946
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective , uneconomic division of Europe ' s meagre resources .	0.10971115536897945
The form the aid takes is important .	18.55301599205078
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .	9.305987188933013
For example , state guarantees , on which the Commission has just publicised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .	5.951161617558716e-05
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .	0.5734109005447343
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .	6.804660675188082
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .	0.5766475449965536
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .	0.8911105235794843
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .	0.29470949480013714
Mr Rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .	11.26122241617407
In my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .	0.22367348970843146
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .	0.5059532008640876
Mr President , Mr Monti , the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union , not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years , but also with a forward-looking view to the Union ' s enlargement .	0.006383678713723925
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts .	0.006520543834703297
Moreover , I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro , Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority , sent me , and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .	0.007172434207351848
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market , and , above all , to achieve consistency between the different national markets .	0.000987565606591734
As things stand , there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English , Italian and French markets .	0.023061665507780223
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy .	5.326566812704471
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .	0.4761100596274722
In my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed : small and medium-sized businesses , which bind the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy .	0.00277098539017987
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people ' s quality of life .	0.04076248004593394
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .	0.2698302512973041
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .	0.43765980012115663
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .	6.214856849450739
Mr President , competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force .	0.07222182965977274
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .	0.005145752108543072
In his report , Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well .	0.07437224827689945
But Europe is changing .	89.70024624603998
The economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States .	0.0330062625827454
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy .	12.44306585257407
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .	22.108214651159777
This is not in question .	73.74450554422117
Having said this , I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .	0.04561370051670737
How will the Commission , as keeper of the Treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London , Palermo , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ?	1.2126897594884082e-05
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given .	0.30629297504921094
It is not enough to say that , in the Member States , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .	0.004442616915495725
In the Netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .	0.035359349492937536
This country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .	0.011828886126646716
This in contrast to Germany , where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market .	0.15181864921299484
The European Commission ' s belief that , in all quarters of the Union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within catholic circles , we term "foolhardy, " and this is not allowed .	2.6584735154148164e-05
Uniformity needs to be worked on .	49.10891697384563
Think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court .	0.24292638078532808
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .	12.867453043700776
Moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .	0.01041597205854078
What is the Commissioner ' s opinion of this ?	2.757273526713336
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses .	7.713029604073491
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security , the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that , alongside vertical exemptions , horizontal exemptions will also be possible .	0.030721497193094967
Through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .	0.0014734479609155265
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .	10.160307313208623
Moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the yellow card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company ' s very existence .	0.0062509988390176165
Mr President , being the last to speak gives me the privilege , Commissioner , of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total , and , I believe , justified , confidence in you at the helm of this boat .	8.393572128685521e-05
But we all want to be oarsmen on it .	18.693209555727726
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .	9.156617162176865
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform .	6.0985906798724425
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .	11.248799472119305
Firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath , President of the Committee on Economic Affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty .	0.002316342044147961
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed .	11.052549348197338
Secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .	0.03460261398331504
It is true , Commissioner , that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .	0.0017826167080695276
We all agree on this .	38.611391999642656
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses , and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas , of legitimising the nature of the internal market .	0.22064876790387034
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said .	10.339809541524913
There have only been nine rejections .	35.93104634883146
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .	12.663308801058683
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules ! This is therefore an aspect to be considered .	0.131417195208741
Thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .	0.04127621627346396
In this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon .	0.061634554988938384
I believe that biodiversity is good , as is cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that is to say , competition law .	0.0017214508701813018
Here improvements should be made .	22.168070048256606
Only in certain countries , Germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .	0.0005774790227550021
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .	0.11075656671020448
What we cannot do , Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way , and give ammunition , to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good , of the rich , and not of the citizen , or the small and medium business , which , in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements , very late , with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant" , that is to say , after Lord knows how many years , when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement , a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment .	0.0
Commissioner , it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform .	0.04594393607378435
It transcends competition , it transcends the cohesion of the internal market .	0.039634376314787716
I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration .	0.1800003627429761
Therefore , Commissioner , we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .	0.13088019065288103
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects .	0.03277626367254167
In my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bears this out .	0.00036075437192593414
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .	7.137754721346316
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction .	0.23236304575017694
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aims to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people .	0.04573146997101835
I , personally , would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report .	0.057690573712971364
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups .	10.047076278955354
I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .	0.0007279304082069782
The groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty .	0.0009680167874195221
I will take these very quickly one at a time .	11.055491864174307
Efficiency : I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .	0.3410990205480594
The current notification instrument , ladies and gentlemen , no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that , in 35 years , there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which , in the majority of cases , receive a simple comfort letter .	0.02803384662386878
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements , and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .	0.07449417254178088
The question of renationalisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , I would like to point out and stress , several times if I may , that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that , as far as Regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of renationalisation .	0.0032561022228078814
Of course we have pondered this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .	0.02673484786654534
At the end of the day , I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .	0.14355894175370748
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .	7.749121286657472
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .	0.44343416372219757
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term , used by Mrs Randzio-Plath , and , moreover , I fully agree with it - of European competition culture .	0.003355150229632256
So , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .	0.10239606447922206
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of Community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .	0.0350903894528548
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .	0.0012780524960995187
The question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated .	0.04492237238413312
As with many other provisions of the Treaty , Articles 81(1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and I do not feel that this has created serious problems .	0.0029625121563281237
In a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .	0.20759952050296057
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice .	0.2377874117717393
Secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .	0.019663289942535245
In this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jrgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation .	0.29042843325307466
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation .	29.876908211363716
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .	10.453063251328343
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts .	0.630632952453378
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .	8.632737764229823
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , Mrs Peijs .	0.03763564237085902
Concerning Mr Evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .	0.22056791636743153
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .	0.011484066469234736
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business .	6.9569470050118225
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .	8.848364741326398
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance .	9.487609532516414
This was raised by Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : the issue of SMEs . Many speakers have underlined this .	0.0015229607082853968
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs . We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs . Why ?	0.05798057194996655
Is this simply a political gesture ?	1.4859938411581934
No . In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restraints .	0.05446489153087623
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share .	11.601390677860321
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1) .	5.169142317211483
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs , and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs , first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system , and secondly , by making Article 81(3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit SMEs in particular .	0.00964886349798005
The fourth group is legal certainty .	26.72799423850321
Mr Evans , legal certainty is , of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal professions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe .	0.003823434588648846
Legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .	0.0017116844644605577
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons : by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3) , it will permit authorisation , without a prior decision , of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions ; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions ; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty .	0.021176975353574257
(FR ) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .	11.034273292261679
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than I .	0.3409901844230199
This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof .	12.330707086371293
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined : the exchange of confidential information .	0.2229718686401924
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .	10.970419018032326
(IT ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President , to Mr Rapkay ' s report , and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission ' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy .	0.030199952904902506
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .	6.57567961468898
I will mention only two , in order to be brief .	0.03518116766806621
The first is greater transparency .	56.59779288497986
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as I did right from the moment I had my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .	0.012737944638083944
As regards the international aspect of competition policy , I can confirm , Mr Rapkay , that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject , to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention .	0.0018644954585677336
We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American , Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy , and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation .	0.09627264224545162
Mr Jonckheer , I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union .	0.10579110503378852
I will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important .	0.2661267719801642
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.0726674453608679
With regard to your suggestions , Mr Jonckheer , you already know that my staff , who , although short-handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard ' .	0.0003540118492721522
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey , which , according to the scheduled timeframe , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in January , and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .	0.0008517933265696964
Mr Jonckheer , Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid .	0.34290981452491365
I can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .	0.012876063764753785
I can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid .	0.019885087689423753
In connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jrgensen , among others regarding repayment of illegal aid .	0.08199053307021929
In April 1999 , the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .	0.11297554738554574
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .	7.355605563184472
Finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .	5.682985106846729e-05
I would like to say that , as we know , the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure , pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty , but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector .	0.017963859298786463
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in July 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .	0.01732886647178695
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .	0.3884049116470036
So , Mr President , I will walk away from this debate , for which I am very grateful to Parliament , in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament ' s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the House , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .	0.0035640846684425014
I am especially grateful for all of this .	10.423126460051293
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , and , at a more general level , with Parliament .	0.0007056355727905654
In this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .	0.00011952579450968083
Competition is not an end in itself , as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in European integration .	0.017219812428422878
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept : it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy .	0.09186031045000291
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the European integration process , as it has done in the past .	0.008510653913225889
Thank you , Commissioner Monti .	1.489817904041704e-05
The joint debate is closed .	42.02533822259328
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000 ) by Mrs Theato , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , containing Parliament ' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests .	0.04739338137606454
Mr President , year after year we learn , mainly from the European Court of Auditors ' test reports , that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage , mismanagement , and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud .	0.001845472660346201
For some time now , these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer ' s money , which , when all is said and done , is what sustains the Union ' s budget .	0.008720662661474955
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detecting it , punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .	0.03679676744377745
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring .	0.5923427087378128
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .	8.00282581232589
So far , efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .	0.12365009649239846
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures .	25.961347103917042
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States .	3.5989709181453393
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States , together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .	0.4303499095530365
What is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this .	0.3834566431310462
For it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 Member States .	0.0675043382902189
After five years only four have done so .	15.562809090061812
This state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union , has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office .	0.03695519451139104
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity .	0.12376513263068145
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .	5.528911765224919
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as articulated in its position , together with those of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .	0.007192843926848369
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .	0.057052662314154366
In addition , we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union ' s financial interests , and in which main principles are firmly established .	0.05373527903420466
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment .	9.997629527902262
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .	22.345603534491048
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission , for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF .	0.8196541391925123
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .	8.110766017899108
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks , which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union ' s financial interests , and to OLAF ' s relationship with the national authorities .	0.24247424577680232
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States .	6.457761150296863
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .	15.337952045634927
In addition , we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts , the so-called corpus juris , and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared .	0.030058560322448833
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men .	7.71080749843876
The Commission , Mr Barnier , Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea .	0.0007772605555528647
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority .	0.0019016042908395672
We can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary .	0.0034514106040195395
Mr President , I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato .	0.1259348808549677
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area .	0.010153043699959653
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4) .	11.903203976963823
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .	0.6293414681950743
The Treaty is a collection of complex articles .	20.998631370692255
However , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize .	0.14417397145308322
At the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community ' s financial interests , as Mrs Theato has explained very well .	0.03500694641996697
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community .	8.637814349797578
But be careful .	139.10808286693538
As the French say , "ne jettons pas le bb avec l'eau du bain " [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water] , that is to say , in the protection of the Community ' s financial interests , we must respect , on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States , but also other matters which affect the citizens , which affect the essential guarantees .	0.0036375470253448023
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly .	21.977614510975663
Therefore , in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and , of course , as an MEP , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission .	0.0018397928055987876
Mr President , this , as Mrs Theato said , is a critical report .	3.893257326394399e-06
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report .	12.785732905403727
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement .	0.050896775590122734
It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is .	10.362074064276372
We need to do something about it .	40.151956887371384
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget .	8.459594756314466
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .	0.4730271896059723
We need to take this responsibility seriously .	73.6658089331659
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union .	7.279516873124447
The question is : who prosecutes ?	0.0004233728600524964
That is where we really get into difficulty .	22.50577363898081
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers ?	1.9082243977858069
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States .	9.256401389968
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .	12.926572859003818
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .	4.537045152113086
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions .	10.650058300844186
Of most importance to Parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the European Union , is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions .	0.03062523823891562
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .	7.735706700203042
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .	0.20775658681048276
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio .	8.851718125009297
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question .	8.178022025237626
We are aware that it is a delicate debate .	35.31109229279588
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .	8.724586867339541
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor .	0.36323554283771725
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .	14.012303468654546
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report .	0.0191802631355068
I think it is a first-class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .	0.004879207109840074
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .	5.235579474952509
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .	0.14598115906896844
We all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the Union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .	0.011890635721959579
But the Member States failed to cooperate .	33.94219259353061
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , I think .	0.05105669652028262
It is now possible , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , that the Commission will take new initiatives , and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .	0.013153494833654179
Unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor .	0.008422949636525059
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .	0.32061268858354197
I think what we need is , at European level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .	0.011307265215601728
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .	16.030504932228922
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong , especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union , then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another .	0.13072069841047868
This , I thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .	1.7931109177913067e-05
I would like to make one general point on politics .	20.479218683407925
Whatever we may say about the European elections , the low turnout is a fact .	0.07089524681574876
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly , and this must be done at European level .	0.14217308216467484
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .	0.0038516861636656453
Mrs Theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .	11.17302661120425
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout .	0.7684382148857154
Yet , every year we have the same problem .	0.027689070179379417
The Court of Auditors publishes its report , which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud .	0.323225791476785
So far , however , the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .	0.004206976918048222
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .	13.590050641063526
I believe that Mrs Theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .	5.600531500562892
It is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e . forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework .	0.008674252212510765
We will need the European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects .	0.02973132222733418
Having said all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .	0.01808140938168073
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people .	16.23596944831832
Unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity .	0.025211352368247203
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato ' s report receives more support .	9.674167117129077
Mr President , we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled , even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests can be guaranteed .	0.05976395717113851
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system .	0.7506051018165706
Indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is , and will be , fierce .	0.00016611855443641343
Indeed , it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system .	0.6241176250590876
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .	5.191435538475007
In any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties .	0.06739378966255537
On behalf of my group , but also personally , I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States .	0.09314588569662706
Therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the Theato report ; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda .	0.015181771604293444
Mr President , Mrs Theato ' s report on the protection of the European Union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor .	0.24191824126247796
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .	5.4900379208285095
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .	0.02738799623345346
Moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms .	0.10471955746407502
According to the Theato report , the European Public Prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office , OLAF .	0.00021966227800928294
At the same time , however , we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court .	0.051694209923947125
In this way , a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .	0.010259064992107374
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then , why not a European Minister of Justice , supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament ?	0.028738292953399296
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .	0.6102879268164846
In the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form , organised around a superstate .	0.13250566336251818
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network .	0.013550306589448948
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances .	0.0008204729680605669
So the legal framework , Mr President , is already in place .	8.536806434214844e-05
It is fine , in principle .	0.0005059906975419984
It need only be fine-tuned .	52.09875725978986
Mr President , Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .	0.015242191162665933
Public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution : a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General .	0.04196382304395784
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI , the European police , in the form of OLAF .	0.017433673280289143
All this would be established by two regulations , one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code .	0.1659970692269431
The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty , i.e . based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .	0.006894068445222014
And indeed there is a twofold shift .	43.20754408444317
Firstly , the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single VAT , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .	0.000336847909733644
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion , while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences , free trade areas , customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource , GDP , as a result of the budgetary rationing pact .	0.007455431585171364
Next we have the Puritan shift : the Teutonic Europe of the North , the Europe of the Lutherans , Calvinists and Quakers , wishes to inflict its moral order on us .	0.0011277386953410776
Basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .	0.00570546802602769
Mr President , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union , more so these days than there used to be .	0.019807510116643313
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe ' s citizens .	7.736699001395195
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .	4.07065307599037
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law .	0.3570713703542808
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .	10.556216548788608
Now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity .	0.109478449622997
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level .	6.148095551565463
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage .	0.4441682949808541
Now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report , is actually about taking action in the EU ' s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the Member States ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly .	0.0006532818134995147
The compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned .	0.041521860598779735
Taking these aspects into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF .	0.004775070932741565
Mr President , will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds ?	0.008719083704165754
I do not believe so .	99.49914208103601
On the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .	0.079825276691971
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust , as proposed at the last Summit .	0.21288042777433908
In the way it is structured , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes .	0.1642682701589198
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .	8.704227473212045
OLAF , Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and , when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this .	0.0228731574593051
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement .	8.59500093718162
It is simply too bad , and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor ' s Office instead .	0.46020821598829054
However , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office .	0.07801951382800358
It is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .	0.0006121029461802058
Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .	10.743877649741716
Instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .	0.13528414035448463
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .	0.0018534365572605608
At the moment , Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .	0.25507425601993816
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions ! Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .	0.635307905830356
But the question is now : is the European Union doing anything about it as well ?	0.01696562350960315
The answer to this is that we know very little about this .	14.19299179634109
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime .	26.066797695081117
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .	0.0009597378481838378
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .	0.018022316526316536
So a great deal has to be done in this area .	15.60093825119395
And what exactly should be done ?	1.345899703731848
Two things , and Mrs Theato ' s report clearly spells these out .	0.015282128038226818
Firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union .	0.10588576656568816
So , unification in this small area .	0.009021541300414108
Secondly , we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosecutors , helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and , secondly , to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .	0.013493536879972219
The European Public Prosecutor ' s Office is nothing to be afraid of .	10.69777163147247
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on .	18.717456359794102
It is , in fact , something very positive .	1.7786224559048872e-06
Just like Europol .	191.93154808051537
Europol , involving police cooperation , does not rank above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .	0.0032997873715548223
This is exactly the task which a small , limited , European Public Prosecutor ' s Office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .	0.0012761293406349406
Parliament supports this .	134.12697074647537
The Committee of Wise Men supports this .	25.76341678525425
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same .	13.150399879125224
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .	0.01632777421613202
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue .	6.199735162278364
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .	9.515387873187553
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK .	4.533876085607275
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about .	9.443227828419468
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget .	6.2430053943405035
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists , with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time , Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado , said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity .	0.12981978319547938
We need a public debate on this .	19.210903420007234
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed .	15.290159934654953
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed .	8.29733796924961
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .	11.99445538185089
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate .	7.7611094774885245
Mr President , on behalf of the Italian Radical Members , I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control , because I share the concerns that have been voiced , in such an authoritative way , by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law .	0.0007113052063903121
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed , to be crushed .	0.08892521478460937
Nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair , Mrs Theato , will not be without its critics .	0.0009839295887551032
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .	19.957078137232575
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .	10.255858953760772
Nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this .	0.03972400522169801
That is to say , they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .	0.4338137504690516
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee .	8.85245972791455
Mr President , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament , during the plenary sittings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .	0.012288525979917314
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .	0.17623520054620193
Today , something has changed , at least in terms of mechanisms , and especially as regards monitoring , but we are still not satisfied , particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor , crimes , fraud , the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one ' s office at European level .	0.0009399941331326214
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life .	0.05745421070377271
For this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States .	0.030427965091687294
In this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?	0.027326774145498663
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .	11.026993838788712
Today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .	0.24577882098054685
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular points .	0.02687470737003726
Firstly , I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States , although I am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system .	0.11182895480430217
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but I digress .	0.07403956627157396
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato ' s report .	7.244804502459549
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities .	6.147234333490163
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2 .	16.947832930121443
After all , there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , European authority , or "body " to quote Mrs Theato .	0.0001331000597933063
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .	12.813200949667806
We also face difficulties with regard to offences .	31.2319057429101
Nothing has changed there .	89.70024249879637
As has always been the case , there are offences that transcend European offences , as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include money-laundering , receiving stolen goods , and forming a criminal organisation .	0.0005919631305744892
As far as that is concerned , I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .	0.15304707725793107
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs .	4.362653773011558
Mr President , for years , Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests .	0.0035163544856779195
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection ) which , five years after being signed , has still not been ratified and has still not come into force .	0.12436236241189101
On the other hand , more pro-active attempts , such as OLAF , which is currently operating , have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .	0.0008965314785739776
The proposals in Mrs Theato ' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the Community budget .	0.0061434951782087365
These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community .	7.513074099162898
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF , without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice .	1.015853968531545
Finally , following on from what was agreed in Tampere , the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor .	0.009331562541906662
This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino ' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .	0.792889916709062
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the Union ' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community ' s economic life .	0.999092342426774
Nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .	0.015496748238030506
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the Member States ?	0.00024849753872761723
As there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor ?	0.01999475304734508
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?	0.20089885080647393
Mr President , the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny .	0.004757597264578949
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged .	30.054518505893693
To remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .	0.01798969027721403
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .	9.098156231938855
At the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .	0.44527235283025557
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States .	5.637630418459629
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .	6.7512035965486055
On the other hand , I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .	0.35537598392302666
In the present situation , I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .	0.054493675412450725
We have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .	0.10560839576025306
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered .	0.042662701230344185
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .	0.0031131342345056792
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .	0.10030913297710214
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten ' s report .	6.979534114615291
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .	11.075364202909567
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .	0.29999517743195453
The major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .	0.008753568266614435
This requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .	0.00010992100819049919
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .	11.102473632750021
Mr President , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .	0.03818647370504397
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .	7.700883569228787
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .	0.09236533280337729
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union .	0.1811566469277782
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty , all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment .	0.5171270348497634
Yet as things stand , only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 .	0.12911469817797655
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation A legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste .	0.02972163621524577
OLAF , the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .	0.3153803966335037
Accordingly , the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks , the ECB and the EIB , contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations , citing their independent status .	0.005177376426337116
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and I hope that Parliament approves this step .	0.35298268403677613
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions .	6.243406197000717
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which was set up at the same time as OLAF , to safeguard the independence of OLAF , however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF .	0.044838052823760854
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .	10.47759560852764
In other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .	0.51527546743732
There is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority .	0.694228174938976
No , there must be no undermining of OLAF ' s authority , and neither do I think this was the rapporteur ' s intention .	0.026036838871857905
As such , I would ask you to give OLAF ' s work your full support , also in its present form .	0.004009475534675189
Thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .	2.4217539493748203e-05
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . VOTE (Parliament approved the Commission proposal ) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE) .	0.026584988671140085
Mr President , on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure : namely Rules 133(2 ) and 138(4) .	0.014374318327441285
These are both about voting .	52.098755460677125
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ?	0.010813305260268032
That is quite right , Mr Heaton-Harris .	0.002568844330501717
I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .	5.723407060180249
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it .	7.783887082568327
In this particular case , I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .	0.4781657864651325
Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .	0.021156511796546672
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .	0.016753124228075258
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .	29.650016867271507
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?	0.03401249410285034
Mr President , as far as the second reading is concerned , the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament .	0.006327825177827421
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it .	14.949453889061045
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended ) Report (A5-0104/1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD ) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) Report (A5-0108/1999 ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report (A5-0107/1999 ) by Mr Berend , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report (A5-0069/1999 ) by Mr von Wogau , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report (A5-0078/1999 ) by Mr Rapkay , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the European Commission ' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998 ) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report (A5-0087/1999 ) by Mr Jonckheer , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) Report (A5-0073/1999 ) by Mr Langen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code ) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Own resources .	0.0
(FR ) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources .	15.286211901956364
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP , especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy , which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences .	0.28745751293009103
Since then , Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources .	0.006738426189572954
Since then , of course , this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .	0.0027921945203737597
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .	15.550893731026607
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission .	0.2805901942246179
Furthermore , the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States .	0.21365563319553146
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code " , the "European Public Prosecutor " or a European police force , with OLAF .	0.02806683446952058
There is as yet no federal European tax .	17.553992750967062
All the same , a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025 .	0.007512953545149569
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999 ) - (FR ) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .	3.1998697671592713
In recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .	0.010292838814359754
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .	8.552034783329235
It therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .	0.011834481568587164
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement .	23.437032124356037
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport is involved .	0.004788669912460428
In order to facilitate achieving this objective , Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .	0.4689933939813189
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .	0.26590108997099793
While this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .	0.2546983293533642
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised , high-level training of safety advisers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates .	0.05296605266872398
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised .	13.07813914568599
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .	6.227319037620508
Parliament voted in favour of this text .	29.01573863662269
It did , however , table a number of amendments , most of which were adopted in the Council ' s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body ' .	0.016202652450499996
In order to be realistic , I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .	0.43875434317169865
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .	1.151660547792269
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999 ) Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .	6.408336116809081
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then .	8.167159777631502
Essentially , my opinion is as follows : I deplore the fact that , in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods , we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment .	0.004143417355208425
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997 .	5.263272462932254
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999 .	12.456701344507628
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .	13.431289047786152
In line with the usual procedure , it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR) , applicable throughout Europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU .	0.045269865387516164
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .	11.015193878816577
Consequently , the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements , as should have been the case ! This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .	0.059071897714767375
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .	6.6508236377983225
Until then , there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations .	0.024119421682141956
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .	0.23821919064850727
They may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable European standards .	0.001508485717166477
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .	6.179480233704306
In offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .	0.008339645813944762
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999 ) Mr President , I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development .	0.46092796810362036
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe .	6.094315337873926
Not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .	0.009918801714598422
Despite the fact that the Community , through the structural funds among others , injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe , these disparities continue to exist .	0.008876791992337561
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .	0.21390469092897563
Mr President , in relation to the Schroedter report , I am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier , that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland .	0.023996412648835994
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .	12.430230958549817
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .	19.392653548376117
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report , I have this important reservation .	0.14712747200020695
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006 .	6.059615299443971
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds .	5.218629285054397
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds .	0.6138960789277402
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .	9.82070430303491
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds .	6.277584319157104
For example , we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe .	0.48972425613903253
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .	7.557040108685066
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas .	0.5036494077732891
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .	8.282303111690924
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland .	6.877352734761622
Once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .	0.042271408435370694
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006 , other EU initiatives such as "Equal " and "Urban " will be operating .	0.26357941390356593
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent .	6.091827328399067
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes .	7.651553865536205
They must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .	0.2828933745364055
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , European and local funding .	0.3880393855269519
.	1.0
(FR ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .	7.811154118253606
In order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .	0.006627866417106111
But more especially because , even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .	0.03974888916138967
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .	7.031795642249324
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .	0.046272674786438026
This is a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affairs , drawn up in collaboration with Member States , regions and local communities , with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming .	0.023713260287065833
This is why I shall support this report , despite regretting the fact that , for timetabling reasons , the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States , regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 .	0.00395542328707946
Moreover , I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .	0.047174420101889825
Mrs Schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .	9.958355793735011
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved , chiefly those involved at a local level , who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems , hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships , which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned .	0.025028364511451063
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .	0.4501123583338428
In order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .	0.033123687710889915
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid .	10.284875699869414
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .	0.07360378790731777
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .	0.2950836902011524
In the meantime , let us support this first step .	0.025661727368902723
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States .	4.859880940557546
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .	0.10186829542095205
In my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping .	0.10262195569837988
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .	0.1941038160533168
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field .	0.5029523359968202
Illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .	0.0004940262207084453
There are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .	0.00011705040963746934
In all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained .	0.008963820730787995
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law .	0.37770777053710686
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per Member State .	5.250961704713593
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed .	6.044858799352054
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .	7.781609669796215
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling .	9.561234627183017
Much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe .	0.013299466944441627
.	1.0
(PT ) The Commission ' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund .	6.955577787867592
It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States .	0.5536144323135332
Unfortunately , the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight .	0.38053587635945735
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions , of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples .	0.9777857962393779
This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .	11.12620232910139
The truth is though , that the Commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .	0.10760046628473896
On the other hand , it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity , and supporting the social economy and solidarity .	0.10569898633439077
There must also be support for rural development , for small and medium-sized enterprises , for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas , specifically in the field of social housing , with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .	0.005030120662285282
.	1.0
(IT ) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities , we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled , or rather in some cases , as with Italy ' s Objective 1 zones , paradoxically , disparities are being exacerbated , particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures ; despite the changes to the rules , the Community structures have not yet been streamlined .	0.008750947040577273
In the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .	0.004951485948786601
In this respect , the Commission document has shortcomings , as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .	0.006209671627933356
SMEs , micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators " , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States , including Italy , are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds .	0.004376052254703662
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time .	6.082332821350058
In view of this , in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report) , the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time .	0.013474101383764812
In fact , it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States , and it published the guidelines back in July 1999 , even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties , thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines .	0.015057739675644317
This is why the mid-term review , provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99 , will be of considerable importance .	0.00897674678708981
In general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .	0.01323315751576168
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies , and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities , or candidate countries .	0.15417823257728494
That said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .	0.0002661522045876478
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions , we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows , in practice , a policy of integrated interventions , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary .	0.011345581866213665
We could then , theoretically , also support the Commission ' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level , but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which , owing to a whole string of converging negative factors , have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels , with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could , in fact , amount to a negative intervention .	0.003907874745940885
The guidelines , as adopted by the Commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in ascending order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .	0.002972016773609777
We could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .	0.008449490513144283
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument , which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and , moreover , would accord proper status to local bodies which , being independent , could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly , and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency , concentration and administrative reform .	0.008525707550846967
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .	0.7774303533436288
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal , rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs , which are no longer solely connected with agriculture , in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also , for instance , in rural tourism , sport and cultural activities , environmental projects , SMEs , services , and so on .	0.0
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy .	6.9440528496356855
The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines" .	6.902229181123366
I must also stress that once again the Commission is , in fact , skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .	0.006210010893366816
In conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .	0.00046987567447116145
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999 ) .	71.19511234138263
(PT ) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union .	3.6088135234474317
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .	16.227246916021983
Firstly , and as the Commission itself states , it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Lnder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards .	0.24696708617279625
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union ' s per capita GDP level .	13.119256028638878
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment .	4.473957088406134
This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies , with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area .	0.2529167526305702
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States , which is what the report proposes .	0.365246442425658
Finally , but no less importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State .	0.000712583934394327
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue .	4.30130507743079
This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other ) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State .	4.195135676177314
.	1.0
(FR ) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union ' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment , the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .	0.8842125862763311
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power .	10.948499276644501
A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today .	7.974670638892939
The management of ABB Alsthom Power , following a merger carried out in June 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries .	0.05835491176230115
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council , in existence since 1996 .	0.021125297616553785
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened .	8.652210889472062
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .	0.09524489381745212
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect , I abstained .	0.12358709682226131
.	1.0
(PT ) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy , the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion .	0.7511896330717205
Issues of mergers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .	0.1058046414378869
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy , moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice , and even aims at having specialised courts .	0.11238448899031744
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States .	6.827411503381141
On the other hand , as the rapporteur points out , in the name of competition policy , public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies , with the privatisation of important industries and public companies , as has happened in Portugal , with harmful consequences for the country and its workers .	0.0009391640758923867
- (FR ) The Commission ' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82 ) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation " of competition policy , as some Members of the European Parliament fear .	0.8800194834717483
But it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union .	0.00416453390925642
In fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion .	0.042776856252112486
The most remarkable thing , in my view , is the message conveyed by this proposal : that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , requires reform of the centralised system .	0.0008902711886133802
Admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .	0.05955445254769784
Indeed , the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .	0.25003998440758
Moreover , the von Wogau report , which the European Parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .	0.00039687745323166147
But at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .	0.2999806590029689
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term .	10.549725936302773
Is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament ?	0.0006510130684151581
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the standardising superstate .	0.00044463642556422816
Curiously , a number of employers agreed with them , preferring the European "one-stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .	0.003924599592816966
Indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .	0.026194702504330838
But , on the other hand , the wider view must also be taken , namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .	0.001014894196313233
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999 ) The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrire Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy .	5.5423082297701525
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .	0.0049138150221352105
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power .	7.3238665199330715
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote .	0.08162330742375061
The Commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements .	0.7619046899116639
This is repulsive most of all in social terms .	18.254555552655297
The European Commission ' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes .	5.410257601473136
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still ! We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .	0.2169508392025001
- (FR ) In voting against this report , we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .	0.5556076033330901
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .	0.17421444401417058
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .	0.5836202509296908
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .	0.05629920140820409
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?	2.327333254409626
We are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .	0.2479833902652309
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?	0.007441300661474544
Finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO ?	0.0008121885014289928
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .	13.394039127171421
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999 ) I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .	0.020926026155419854
I am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this .	9.950392774065191
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition .	5.9648886110667165
Admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .	0.32678187027278255
However , as the rapporteur pointed out , such aid is occasionally essential and may , in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty) , services of general economic interest (Article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158) .	0.00619102861054424
Clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .	0.0004962810916551116
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector .	0.5811302940319603
This aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector) .	0.02395825056724028
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Lnder .	9.052151581630872
Like the rapporteur , I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .	0.211059433554007
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .	8.47181671784976
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the ninth report .	0.5371896746113346
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State .	6.3659313816336685
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid .	9.519352809792524
In order to compensate for this situation , the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .	0.1757825979574814
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU .	0.1806538491230531
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .	0.7388174228142043
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999 ) In the important debate on competition this morning , I expressed my views on Mr Langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code .	0.4416987376631767
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation .	0.40204834540087514
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable , even though Article 4(c) , of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry .	0.11351577296930465
This , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code .	0.0003711031687448774
At the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .	0.0001910418128711086
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .	0.39353681373795857
In the same way , it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code .	0.11250660685183635
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminders .	0.008241735376491451
Like the rapporteur , I am pleased with the Commission report , but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .	0.036179340392351766
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .	0.0215466009263224
In the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .	0.535675479685117
Finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty .	0.08724837762715167
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .	14.94945740929284
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .	5.056547299318801
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission ' s response to our requests and demands .	0.3469777571213369
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m . and resumed at 3 p.m. ) Oil slick off the French coast The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast .	0.0032945136120531193
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission .	8.108239009768964
Mr President , I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but also as an elected representative for Brittany , and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .	0.004587572215575216
Together with Mrs Grossette and the PPE-DE Group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .	0.06521319343445274
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .	15.389146618441087
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue , firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe , with extremely serious consequences for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists , and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale .	0.035013635691606315
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline , and why ?	0.06164183775848384
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act , which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities , as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable , and is more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and , in particular , the existence of the American coastguard .	0.000844158379864611
If , I repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .	0.00025856667320676264
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .	0.010120088425893013
Well , if the charterer is exonerated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .	0.013828047527062085
The regulations must therefore be reviewed , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations .	0.000684296115310838
Moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be stepped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .	9.474144562453724e-05
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission .	5.670777119540121
What are the conditions for this recognition ?	2.629795281630865
What guarantees are there of its reliability ?	1.4142128494905257
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission .	23.257333434053088
We await the outcome with great interest .	20.68922625558327
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up .	9.944889607069241
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .	0.004266825445394689
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries .	7.372619220806678
Why not ?	1.0
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?	1.8340051369137256
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .	0.018945179021132175
If the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .	0.2571600967553524
Finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States .	0.408792595300625
Firstly , I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team .	0.24797136399347766
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .	7.849610687887932
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .	12.704868777779675
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes .	5.920395419328097
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year .	0.23406965039343558
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ?	0.2653763883824057
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ?	2.0411730493589024
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ?	0.03265881899272516
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters : rust buckets badly crewed' .	0.2547718402584917
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .	21.1792752051957
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .	5.576510369688763
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods .	9.5517081791679
Just as the Sea Empress , just as the Braer did .	0.03439320094836288
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .	10.579374769698074
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster , just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions .	0.723771058117405
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea .	0.3341223957652561
The time for resolutions has passed .	30.910791788485888
What is now needed is action .	34.66192153472726
Sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .	0.023427228148356
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .	0.07597338119171038
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .	0.5665514587971167
The "Erika " incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe .	0.33688675803488494
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe .	6.491921960958872
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .	0.004856378891933608
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .	5.908499819405613
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .	9.614817929926105
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays " principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .	5.151545461375169
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?	0.05768269589012556
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .	0.050523419286225765
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .	6.037069722781278
Mr President , Commissioner , I have brought you a small gift .	5.613875994049134e-05
Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows : "With every tide , the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika .	0.13540654652222614
With every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick , sticky , black tar .	9.503439101234164e-05
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident? " Indeed this disaster involving the Erika , like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available .	0.033714607835396086
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , "Never again! " It is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .	0.001715086592798606
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .	7.711285319520912
But , listening to you , Commissioner , we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992 , I believe , the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee .	0.002824798584316574
Indeed , we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many .	0.10150215339304708
This is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes .	0.14129811115152047
We should be aware , for example , that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil .	0.006918407275273391
Why , in these circumstances , is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised ?	0.00018413769718520054
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .	0.005992051956121441
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .	6.975623152878736
In addition , it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO , as a matter of urgency .	0.004731682248400626
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?	0.005089742710832347
Finally , a compassionate thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .	0.005172434835336444
I can testify to this remarkable work .	24.918503653104384
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .	0.06714738554592607
In relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .	0.2642123535874992
And , on this subject , Commissioner , you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats .	0.003668395393323109
Once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .	0.006354907324599322
In the meantime , it is nature that is taking the rap , as always .	0.0006658036949540379
Mr President , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment .	0.1972586414524438
Let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque , spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Mare noire " , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan .	0.0036465587154087963
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .	5.953574709739507
As the European Parliament , we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and , at the same time , demanding tightening up of the quality criteria , on the European and international scale , of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport , stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders .	0.013271205383783272
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .	11.6765951322973
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .	0.35698880179010084
This is no longer tolerable .	59.84890270525141
Next , we have flags of convenience .	0.004814026681948306
According to the International Transport Federation , over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .	0.09481213751280822
This is no longer tolerable .	59.84890270525141
Finally , there is the lack of transparency .	0.007644596649464492
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible .	0.20753832146754206
This is no longer tolerable .	59.84890270525141
In all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double hull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States .	0.0058982661755625125
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .	5.932427601433814
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .	9.196272180378825
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance .	21.289170015921922
This is an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation .	0.004926954468930096
In so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .	9.643905138493189e-05
Mr President , Commissioner , as a Member for the French Atlantic coast , for Vende , I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us , but by a crime .	0.0028623904581704467
In this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .	1.3499284742837203e-05
What the stricken populations are waiting for now , those who have lost everything , particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism , those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come , is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused , but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future .	0.030093361703295435
Quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .	0.013637057554331347
Because our states , with the blessing of the Community , did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience , drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals .	0.04038423767773951
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies .	0.020224362343675195
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .	14.35313238436198
Obviously , such matters should be handled at world level , but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose , and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter , despite previous disasters .	0.010426968530216334
Admittedly , there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund , IOPCF , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .	0.0016270560980566051
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO .	14.637435045363613
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .	9.31766168696364
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the European Union .	0.16298185265383314
In addition , there are Community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .	7.549177239619544e-05
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .	9.835748336097762
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .	0.16343341213185386
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .	22.364505458715396
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again .	6.65045234076006
It is now scheduled for July .	47.28791315386535
This must be brought forward .	52.098690337005436
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .	11.026698446987343
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .	10.97049036780658
Firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .	0.43859764162485
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select .	0.9792496576518407
Secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .	0.4663997002908165
Thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future .	0.2660924362770489
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .	14.702484050023733
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear , strict and trenchant , then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory , in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters .	0.2214196727322933
Thus , the Erika was refused access to American waters .	0.02953131985163295
If the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .	0.10681851143435143
Let us ensure , Mr President , Commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down .	0.0006658876025940135
Mr President , Torrey Canyon , Olympic Bravery , Haven , Amoco Cadiz , Gino , Tanio , so many names we remember with horror .	1.4652870894169124e-07
And now the Erika .	56.50761338831682
Whose turn is next ?	1.1486980881198294
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .	0.001354931487358932
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .	0.2211551351058143
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept , and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety .	0.022287364440412565
And this is the result .	52.6889119340621
The Erika , a vessel flying a Maltese flag , a floating rust bucket , classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz .	0.0018472109172189674
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region , unfortunately , I can testify to this .	0.0016954372534046655
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters , they are the result of fate .	0.08869578029581979
They are the result of human thoughtlessness .	43.13214745174236
What we have here is an ecological disaster .	22.70238374855755
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .	6.333321917635581
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , oyster farmers , shellfish farmers , people who make a living from the salt marshes , shopkeepers , etc .	0.00022579919126563083
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series .	19.08256965709839
First of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .	0.03715256137771433
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission ?	2.8120170312067168
Next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .	0.00011018077750513232
In fact , according to the experts , the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .	0.012562568910046796
We know what actually happened .	60.95193599449619
Next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old .	0.28592162182258035
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea .	0.11677406198194591
This would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .	0.0015776385888893554
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters , the responsibility of polluters , shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays " , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing , thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required , an appropriate "natural disasters " budget line must be re-established for Member States and , in the meantime , Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds .	0.01299117857849717
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group .	11.2108733967664
Mr President , in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .	0.21209587326747031
It is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major European State ; an incident which could happen again at any time .	0.029761009245378806
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks .	11.711775056913028
The 15 clearly do not suffice .	34.661918512064226
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things .	9.131373713141533
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again .	7.643226412677303
All those involved , including the transport agent , are responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .	0.0012549864476150607
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .	11.084884261098752
However , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .	0.0029614133638079404
In other words , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .	0.06579374691802299
Mr President , may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .	0.0004114968399107822
Many thanks for this .	40.979012601580095
This also means that , in any case , I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today .	0.060449107753320346
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second-best .	0.2693432066839087
The damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .	0.0011953383312931479
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members .	14.00864512470363
During the Christmas break , when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster , I had a look , just out of interest , on the Internet to see what arrangements were , in fact , already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures , especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more .	0.0007233366372963113
What I learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .	0.009886835543954808
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner ?	2.5911156470896013
First of all , the port-state control , according to which 25% of all ships require inspection .	0.002546959763874924
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place .	8.100069255386211
So this 25% should be increased .	29.637662793199503
Furthermore , if a ship is no longer seaworthy , not only should the facts be examined , but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used .	0.012823390560529639
But this is not in place .	48.000444953436386
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area .	0.003978557078318981
Finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some Members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the United States , ships should in any case be double-hulled .	0.002044798458837147
In my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Marpol Treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .	0.0011873500382786277
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals .	0.00910197324600897
Mr President , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .	0.015803197494658687
We have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union .	0.10740957737341333
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the Commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers : "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers " .	0.021989284829299797
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .	0.37262953903778273
So what are we to do now ?	1.3935436174154037
I have no intention of talking about past events ; rather I want to look to the future .	0.16907606350859825
What are we to do now ?	1.665538721993407
I will tell you a few things we should do .	10.937431856830466
Of course , we need double-hulled vessels .	0.0006928072593714372
That goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .	0.21436995868908076
So what do we need to happen immediately ?	2.6916296482713187
We need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .	0.019402861932400817
We need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a TV , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany , which is compulsory every two years .	0.008105281995495223
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .	10.397323198653371
This is what we need for ships .	34.57347617084666
Thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union .	0.015643485931711554
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .	0.3945592363849823
We must reach agreement here , in all the European Union ' s ports , from Marseilles , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor .	1.8401765187860786e-05
Fourthly , we need the shipowner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million , but to the value of at least USD 400 million , to be covered per insurance certificate .	0.00296587668443114
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .	9.843984301935832
We need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .	0.23167691212846736
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision ! I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .	5.215883651636756
In the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .	0.009246447926524213
Last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .	0.02250054903283664
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme .	37.35660063768915
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .	6.8616927186883965
The unions will have something to say as will industry .	15.92826522014813
A long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .	0.026261361355674244
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .	7.1556820382406405
Just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .	0.14372804424688604
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .	9.840697861731307
We need to have a long memory when we say : " for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union. " If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time ! Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .	0.033776245602133693
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures .	10.966081932552568
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?	2.4347450571214324
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the Plimsoll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .	0.4376562898917355
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?	1.887746772676027
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion .	0.7123376641605205
We must also critically examine the classification societies .	21.16738150454633
I do not think that we can accept their procedures .	30.638978026742176
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .	15.921784983214904
Finally , I want to say that , when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards .	0.017151576255078387
Within the Commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .	0.10160310779060515
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the Commission ' s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .	0.07870202962141695
Mr President , we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina ' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited , or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers .	0.15011574986900966
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .	6.4218761832590605
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world uninhabitable ?	0.015444356444351163
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments reacting ?	0.258936034356588
The crux of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the European institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .	0.11312814836055943
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .	0.26857470361854363
In these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage .	0.3618224334265458
Mr President , I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .	0.05664686357109028
However , we must stick to the facts .	0.012841104649131341
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .	7.941860625299717
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .	7.286011236552104
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls .	8.228812635315379
I cannot accept this .	87.42466967205644
If the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .	0.017020839978615754
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue .	0.21493174046507976
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .	14.008594259570579
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing .	0.24391493354019453
Secondly , I also share the Commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .	0.23983255839335846
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .	5.247663215292539
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .	10.52319031643575
Mrs Roth-Behrendt , we already have a TV (organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .	0.08596068976165575
There are reputable companies too .	52.09875036596568
You will be familiar with some reputable companies , our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies , but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements , and these must be struck off the list .	0.022461048090950477
Finally , we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements , for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up ! Mr President , Commissioner , the Erika sank near my home and is still there , with 20 000 tonnes in its hold , the fate of which we are waiting to discover .	0.03110051110909538
It could have sunk anywhere .	52.09875313093145
It happened to sink there , and Brittany , where I come from , should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula , and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks .	0.0036866299648137847
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors , who were saved but of whom nothing has been said .	0.16529155210444824
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means , above all , men ' s lives .	0.005678548622586975
By now they are far away .	37.79909227405259
It is a miracle that they were saved .	33.89277417212664
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz ; a wreck on the North coast , a wreck on the South coast , a wreck on the West coast .	0.01852918641234234
Things could well continue in the same way .	14.506695010890196
Commissioner , as time is very short , I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel , and you have already mentioned some of them , are essential to work on : double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports .	0.0041052537836748304
In particular , we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public , as currently , we do not have access to them .	0.0008021347214733476
Then , sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the Union .	0.0009364390236571821
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience , not because they are necessarily bad boats , but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones .	0.039214423142243625
We must improve information on all of the world ' s ships , but provision has already been made for this .	0.2778759542705263
We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them .	9.25916552317587
With regard to this matter , I would like to know who owns the Erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing , but there are always real shareholders in the background .	0.0158137742343327
Where are the Erika ' s owners ?	1.3935444189988309
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches , getting a nice tan .	0.09196410247914581
We would like to know their names and their faces .	20.756560109729467
Finally , there must be improvements in the training of crews .	0.04352021665089531
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk , but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety .	0.29450297497817807
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .	0.0029168021630772358
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .	0.5158653666884111
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika .	7.381722514331325
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .	11.055742425925375
It should be noted that the oil industry , through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds , regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol , for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident , or some USD 170 million .	0.00848276901729666
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .	0.34162426237823795
However , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .	0.08800975466174071
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .	6.753202635499039
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .	7.8088806793292225
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .	7.093486574533631
Calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .	0.01992332192052325
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .	21.61149614250975
Mr President , I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .	0.0035226401940787384
Because , as well as the irreparable damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry , the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resources , and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover .	0.00304474910655341
It is no accident , Commissioner , that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed , those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .	0.0014915648040134673
These are the same areas , Commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts , without any control whatsoever .	0.01193765382663251
I come from a region , Galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .	0.001634046480000732
Brittany and Galicia , two European 'Lands Ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks .	0.1185543339163861
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .	14.946501306242947
On the one hand , by asking the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .	0.004037141870009514
In this regard , the current process of negotiations on Malta ' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag .	0.6543681035326421
On the other hand , prevention is essential .	0.007488733822433218
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .	10.183352348830573
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level , using all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future .	0.23091736230240467
Lastly , Mr President , I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then Mayoress , I lived through similar situations .	0.00042072550074293073
We must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks .	0.013948600223263356
Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like to congratulate the Commission , and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which has really shaken the whole of Europe .	0.0002556087976282331
We , as the Committee on Transport , are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .	0.0002754575536522996
In addition , I should like to make a number of comments : First , the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA , the Italian shipping register , because we need to know if Community law was applied .	0.0009690929867536522
That should be the starting point for our efforts .	20.63509620814534
Secondly , apart from the shipowners ' liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers , for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and , of course , for restoring the damage .	0.0022681959310285314
Once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .	0.09658122444281979
However , this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .	0.00036449868339441413
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but , as other members have stressed , we need to start with application , because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .	0.04393640814008646
This legal framework is fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States , under the supervision of the Commission , should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied .	0.019340926216272446
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact , as others have said this afternoon , constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where , since 1967 , there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers ; more than one every two years .	0.0008959367907548225
The economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions .	0.030126343701862728
Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .	0.4102262454102446
I trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st Century pirates , who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .	0.0015513559443622545
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues .	0.38489651316939943
I am referring to the double hull , which consists of two layers of steel , with containers divided into two tanks .	0.015121034804374366
Commissioner , there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull ' in which case , in the event of an accident , the seawater penetrates the containers and , as a result of pressure , the oil is transferred to other tanks .	0.004240694634404296
Commissioner , I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures .	0.13464844623452588
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries .	9.813013988483448
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .	12.091283940456579
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .	0.38651169494738713
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us , after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings , finally to produce a joint resolution .	0.006155989878371653
I think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .	0.020117920839111295
On the other hand , Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me .	0.03579222994148168
I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area .	6.500407374381872
I think that it is quite obvious , and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .	0.12298052871741354
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common airspace , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area .	0.008288198499872097
I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .	6.230605393998452
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .	0.3338556583070504
I have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty , or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate , and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action .	0.005713137988302471
We sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .	0.0002910378335719794
In this area we must respond to public opinion .	11.61876118731338
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .	0.015963061118526214
Therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .	0.007933988821524537
We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deterrent .	0.02231664777030459
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .	0.8483615637644045
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .	9.544612245289885
Mr President , the oil tanker Erika , the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil , foundered off the Breton coastline , with disastrous consequences .	0.0057268754489660885
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous .	12.27630246407357
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .	8.58370333585173
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .	7.974665957312601
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection .	11.37436929849696
States can carry out port inspections .	37.79908717968882
In Europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive .	0.13888655229892136
However , it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .	0.2465111344907547
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation .	19.610986881283534
In my opinion , the Commissioner is quite right .	0.009049109731175717
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .	13.701969805933864
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed European Commission ?	0.09589270995844257
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States ?	2.1076104914978684
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?	1.6605504739025025
Would it not be beneficial , in the short term , following the Rotterdam model , to inspect according to a points system in which , for example , account is taken of the ship ' s age , whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience .	0.0008686654309384284
In short , to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .	0.03522396136666609
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled .	11.571302790480196
There are four more sister ships in service at present .	10.392659459712574
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high .	10.075296125233372
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag .	14.56354545741568
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?	2.6389797142443774
Would sanctions not be appropriate , as the Commissioner stated , for the classification society ?	0.00016069134117353687
RINA is currently the talk of the town .	20.40308984988611
Malta is entering the accession negotiations .	23.29840103489079
In my opinion , the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .	0.29058871596392566
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission .	0.36965162049414524
Mr President , just before I went down into the Chamber , I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year ' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives .	0.11708506017576469
Like many other hundreds of volunteers , she had seen the destruction , washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there .	0.21129653667122777
Like so many others , I too wonder where the people responsible are .	0.06345859857025302
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur ?	2.111094348221774
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .	5.966943059826038
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether intentional or unintentional .	0.22293718364223714
(The President cut the speaker off ) I would like to thank Mrs Grossette and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .	5.760044174236021
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media .	5.446459089081403
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .	0.38905323413686554
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar British disasters , such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many British volunteers to help .	0.008077111790430774
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .	10.368098320921458
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .	11.147879889866921
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London , we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil .	0.6974745793573156
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab .	7.384846432325141
Ultimately , the polluter must pay .	0.004227598178599865
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .	3.6809599139831226
Moreover , although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .	0.04597885552527489
Rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .	0.05430429545732153
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament .	0.007444367738927388
Mr President , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force majeure .	0.006919774189957504
The victims are waiting outside .	52.0987568477265
They want answers .	191.93154808051537
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .	0.2825274308134778
The citizens are right to ask : "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever? " Who will provide us with new jobs ?	0.14261863962273683
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint European challenge .	0.18793814355699773
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio ' s action plan with open arms .	12.377264938174232
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure " .	12.026776813367967
But there is an art to that as well .	19.441733917830753
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk " - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help .	5.4028590618547385
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .	9.399110959692639
Valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone .	0.17536185462175552
We are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .	0.07780601486532712
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in Parliament .	0.11792322164663754
The issue is as topical as it was before .	20.171940823521027
Furthermore , I will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation .	0.0068070308477310645
Mr President , firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks , not only for the initiatives of the different groups , of Mrs Grossette and the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats , but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left , who proposed this debate , which has led to a positive and important discussion .	0.008670250240618661
Before the end of March , I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts , that is to say , amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament .	0.01634426664246612
I would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem .	0.05270897448312494
There are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas .	0.29624516938871165
They are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium .	0.23922754287100306
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .	10.393109134225123
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .	12.610266248854817
In fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .	0.002591798219884649
This was demonstrated by the Americans who , after the Exxon Valdez disaster , within one year , adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as I said earlier , to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe .	0.00021879021879511507
In Europe , after the Amoco Cadiz , or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast , in 1976 , or the Torrey Canyon , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .	5.811449311048017e-05
During these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .	0.10816892701855824
That is the reality .	121.57398081442057
In my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .	0.01974606108017426
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months .	0.023091158143617438
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March , also coinciding with the Council of Ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency , for us to have texts to discuss .	0.0019856578341559067
Flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .	0.045862746310228276
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .	0.006647689411923123
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community .	15.903733724008276
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .	12.692025459272147
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a Community register .	0.006774340784031235
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries .	0.042646483839577594
As for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as Mr Hatzidakis has said .	0.006050246055976172
We already have legislation .	113.01519388516196
According to the information which the Commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .	0.06679822137544965
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected , but rather how we select , how we find , the ships which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags .	0.004804879191552711
Unfortunately , the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily .	0.03899703088983418
Therefore , more than making amendments , we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done , apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews , especially in relation to the age of the different vessels .	0.005803283763232764
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) , two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored .	1.2465905361512517
With regard to the question of Union inspectors , I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States , which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately .	0.26244387640411854
Lastly , I would like to stress the issue of liability .	0.04559921273526241
Not only in terms of maximum sums insured , which I believe should be similar to those in the United States .	0.18467481828408142
We have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .	0.3734804214227756
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States , but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shipowners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .	0.007414753397165077
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .	0.0009353788539660407
I will end now .	107.72431344449787
I will not expand further .	78.73209082215902
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .	18.754788167863662
But , obviously , as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years , we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done .	0.0054337252251656955
As for me , I can say , after having debated it in the College of Commissioners , that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures , amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council , in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .	0.0028975335315750183
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers .	8.57902286289646
Thank you very much , Commissioner .	0.0010244419272122105
We have taken good note of your intentions .	31.82793590733432
I have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with Rule 37(2) , to close the present Commission statement .	0.00765111272107739
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m . Storms in Europe The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe .	0.02469695612826427
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission .	6.322965396065315
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .	0.030671660517535657
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2 .	3.9160950409643682
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .	0.11395800784755669
In fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .	0.17327027443489526
We should therefore put this situation right immediately .	23.013620859816037
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .	0.2594300376546861
Let me explain .	145.45691353081207
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest .	8.368734799966292
Indeed , for some 'forestry ' districts , which have lost 20% of their trees , this represents a huge loss .	0.000645140766581033
We know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .	0.0005585161070330155
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .	13.408658007760248
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .	7.065778163549538
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .	8.861439365436471
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .	12.786632561052455
Indeed , you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate .	0.2033898853566821
On the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years .	0.05343051848383603
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .	5.9617520909517365
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is , and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .	0.49667205498520745
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophes are still to come .	0.03027295498112081
As you yourself said , Commissioner , these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .	0.004441335121530334
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .	13.683009374956905
Mr President , everyone who has travelled here by car , train or aeroplane , has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in France , caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month .	0.0016032749852319028
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?	2.994932132078835
Firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services .	0.002189298923601579
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens .	23.801125838228504
Next , I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union ' s Member States who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their French colleagues .	0.021044254223111434
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .	12.387617124092888
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey , we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims , but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so .	0.16166103344558125
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly .	5.998421095684707
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .	0.15287988525393678
As you said , Commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out .	0.07115165690236509
Beyond this , I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .	0.14658994449698098
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .	0.009162771261936173
Mr President , the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion , i.e . EUR 11 billion .	0.00038622166667122155
Almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones , 500 000 hectares of forestry land , or 100 million cubic metres of forest , have been ruined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates .	0.00277862469768017
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .	0.4546982860730683
As the previous speakers have said , and as you said , Commissioner , in response to my fellow Member , Mr Martinez , with regard to another tragedy , the floods in November in the Southwest of France , you have certainly noted these disasters with concern , but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued , which has resulted in this shocking paradox .	0.0007824057371315248
This paradox , pointed out by the previous speaker , is that it is easier , a great deal easier , to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it .	0.0010976148756520617
We know full well that what you are doing , Commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b .	0.02549131033062222
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000 .	9.65720887418977
I can show you a copy if you wish .	13.384449202786621
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission , but also of this Parliament , and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so .	0.11280217701531631
But for pity ' s sake , and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms .	0.11478298600022419
As a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .	0.0005423656585936895
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union .	5.26365367756916
That , however , is another problem altogether .	1.9927427038446238e-05
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .	0.000890234226961353
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December .	5.409843391354168
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .	12.642291018932841
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region , Lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .	0.021162940597567733
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their troubles are not yet over .	0.012069529103174211
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster .	7.0391027418174446
I welcome Mr Barnier ' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced .	11.421006690791403
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .	0.27144006991864383
The Community action programme for civil protection , established by a Council decision on 9 December , was launched on 1 January 2000 .	0.017157105624140998
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity .	23.07835066921829
This programme must work at full capacity .	25.246757493761525
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry .	6.688801138176999
Our priority , as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States .	0.008829956522563982
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .	0.15514445736634563
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .	5.958106113770113
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood .	0.6527725377937852
Finally , it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls .	0.021701140023275327
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States .	6.861228605245217
This aid for gathering timber is , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas .	0.006766888655555693
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .	7.396909739830858
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies .	5.986564381372132
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .	8.161870559588456
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .	0.2420237761911244
Hurricane "Lothar " should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too .	0.2022937633193043
Current programmes must be accelerated .	52.09875271619023
For example , as they stand , the Commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto .	0.0031360995930357874
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shelves it .	0.21234591664113683
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .	8.758931468653506
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .	0.36879763894886247
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate ! Commissioner , Mr President , Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .	0.006750032620305681
However , it has now achieved notoriety .	0.006856288141729257
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in France and Germany , but also in Switzerland , leaving a trail of destruction in its wake .	0.006761773830247463
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .	0.0001977469071049147
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .	0.4252118791644413
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany .	0.6328916107836671
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual .	0.6444834359552231
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?	0.12125416873498387
What answer will the Commission give , when it is on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc. ?	0.012261708268213585
All this is well-intentioned advice .	63.50909551382517
However , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .	0.6719563809755877
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree .	0.22108210754936644
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .	0.49703580201902753
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .	1.1655280344997528e-06
Firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom .	0.0005289225863233547
We are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .	0.0019844081860814094
Secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU .	0.12047548094725224
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders .	7.416009436131346
"We do not have the wherewithal for that, " they said .	0.11433499564094747
This is wrong ! And no one can comprehend this attitude .	11.571302639444683
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .	11.041004315803319
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .	0.09271006717811774
I say they have a right to solidarity .	24.38205468696776
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .	10.396614741823853
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .	7.789131070231628
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .	7.105875178102382
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will .	0.1037868366168703
Permit me one further comment .	47.18707115284307
Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm , the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter .	0.837138762231415
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .	8.85796142183898
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations .	5.4955724601361755
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .	8.82744016112022
Then , for example , people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart .	0.004667083674686229
When , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .	0.0004076301348499555
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work .	0.14144661386389756
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again ! Mr President , Commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems .	0.05420205935730576
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .	9.5349011274009
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be .	7.787865256840041
Of course , there is a need for solidarity here .	0.0035328168653781015
There is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .	0.2449273397155608
But , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature cannot make mistakes .	0.03656353594153683
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests .	0.00017547233307229582
Of course , I am in favour of providing assistance where we can .	0.008113514579498651
But when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground .	0.05066000228112919
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .	0.25914386452649474
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .	12.892436333228604
To this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff .	0.017337110565146148
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go .	7.882432110411041
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream .	16.186669208999827
But in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .	0.07632909109297442
This is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .	0.28503148337910283
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference .	14.628774664903027
We must reduce CO2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of Europe are faring .	0.0003760588135769514
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .	0.012772197058253876
This is an irreparable loss .	85.09001955076981
Secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with France , which is the country worst affected .	0.0022272181917962867
As I have little time , Mr President , I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .	0.0040218804308546135
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .	6.275530886487115
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .	0.057795076180854686
In fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .	0.0025922758639555076
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals .	9.871278809773164
Secondly , I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner ' s proposal to create a European civil protection body .	0.5271858422299045
Furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .	0.0038107421899166794
First of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .	0.2414864620517953
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards .	7.087862806727735
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .	7.223075662574904
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this .	5.784401348982237
That is important .	88.49079947398941
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past .	7.0179966779529455
It was very small .	71.19513143801285
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major .	6.686953562918844
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels , whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies .	0.6042448477743938
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .	10.155570113270551
I think we should reinstate this budget line .	17.573229381544415
When we had the earthquake in Greece , which was a big disaster , the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks .	0.03136299219567385
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now .	12.154488660442581
These are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .	0.0018304858461081154
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .	5.039532442951925
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .	6.6957136590052295
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic .	6.3454293695081105
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these .	7.469386599087856
Ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .	0.049240665077119064
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines .	10.804768059393865
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around .	18.082546824699637
Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under Article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2 ) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds .	0.26610757106314176
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .	0.2980643282786497
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul .	10.29120445041564
This is inadequate , and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security .	0.013600633210443972
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being , if the mandate that our President , Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe ' s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency .	0.11850642235352918
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force , real civil relief blue helmets , who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the Union if needs be , in Venezuela or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see .	0.0025296060496470506
I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit .	4.895533108911223
Mr President , Commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly .	0.0038924379672589746
Nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .	0.4851019757818889
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well .	5.3678691642697665
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .	0.03377409407689772
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .	6.73422640307344
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .	9.850865488017478
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .	6.1660612413220734
For instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle ' s larvae , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .	0.052100370072479134
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives .	11.057446643508419
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .	6.122287499426317
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .	10.844570173387737
The calculations are in decades rather than years .	19.592416410590175
In addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .	0.06900098038794672
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.... .	0.045873893851022994
(The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .	0.26469812054950104
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .	8.907713798597767
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank .	10.725818501023394
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland .	16.07518131130407
We had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .	0.0002165985831212237
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water .	0.0009517323017169896
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water .	7.10587452748188
Natural habitats were destroyed .	89.7002294586794
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case .	12.591672048113386
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force .	11.928194313231325
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .	0.0009674050267860455
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .	11.175038556448863
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe , and I believe we need , in the long-term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .	0.020793715246856956
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way .	0.027850553592684554
Unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .	0.16323096931786948
As has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe .	0.060201071648713265
Of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing , these storms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century .	0.003241689276895931
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , Tom Spencer .	0.5859826309020244
He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .	0.4252915609424913
However , an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability .	0.05392859798273506
We must be aware of this connection ; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course ! I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .	0.4879566424015484
That concludes the debate .	51.17529818162962
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday .	25.204338870643383
Food safety The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission .	6.901344396427053
Mr President , I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety , adopted on Wednesday last , 12 January , in association with my colleague , Mr Liikanen .	0.0006473616078157251
At my hearing last September , I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper .	0.058695174960708967
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .	15.53146422333507
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September .	7.1963438012635335
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published .	6.238429286011283
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the BSE crisis .	0.23772120883342435
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed .	5.931422517429288
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .	6.767595779015956
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .	4.982346143977803
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .	6.7332868937900745
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe .	12.42303253631293
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .	13.096314241218765
This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .	0.08278609811615205
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects .	0.19731344399663014
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .	10.298183953276075
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .	10.122194951932796
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .	3.6761641144371375
In saying all of this , I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .	0.5597926526601634
The challenge is to make the system the very best .	15.992289747291121
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .	4.90175327708181
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .	12.20501604207192
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .	10.117297641621748
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders .	14.844378116861844
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation .	6.758705084442559
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .	0.12480844132065023
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .	8.983015752400588
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .	6.713310292520482
Over 80 measures are envisaged .	47.18707288847232
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .	8.165625331698504
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .	6.873214632599072
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .	15.106179241379397
It has already attracted much comment , including reactions from Members of Parliament .	0.06412453513000967
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments .	6.735145882916816
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage .	13.048061662615789
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .	14.791693096295324
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .	5.479005917866409
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?	2.3095543384047765
The first key concern is independence .	34.661917647621785
Key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .	0.0031871342650415017
We must also ensure excellence and transparency .	25.853017180591873
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis .	5.55207054673468
However , the Commission believes that we must go further .	0.029336565040409882
We must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .	0.1006146537438708
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .	8.20759873987681
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .	6.942097472694143
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment .	5.759072649197819
However , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .	0.007636489629461952
As the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .	0.1008765045743958
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .	9.148828540819105
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .	9.259120181165962
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .	0.48079908452899245
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .	9.483447036966728
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority .	9.035713822332193
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the EU , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States .	0.03564335385317426
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .	6.193464530225031
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .	7.88804841662535
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission , Parliament and Council .	0.10879329062448051
I make no apology for this approach ; I firmly believe that it is the correct one .	0.17661667944919654
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority .	8.814228245574476
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .	13.035515414161784
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .	7.005249193727678
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .	0.02510154469776968
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .	10.291595612209981
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .	10.993878563451805
I also reject this line of argument .	27.26800291911525
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?	2.425136866577202
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens ?	2.357436191173697
In my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .	0.022169048506485857
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .	15.921787715213192
I can assure you here today that the Commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .	0.028737075063793388
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States .	4.515360484790735
This is a major task .	113.97140883874405
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union .	4.697488946734767
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .	8.337852199286816
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .	5.210138797910596
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .	10.859059551072706
However , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage .	0.01768806264564119
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard .	11.536520491525334
As an integral part of a value-added structure , the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .	0.005652252239910256
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .	13.498396939811562
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation .	8.668958042791317
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .	16.308795426125652
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin .	6.109825600943219
This revised Community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at Community level , Community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .	0.009709340112960535
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission .	5.140852172039603
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State .	5.134652974222178
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union .	0.48487191886606595
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level , the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation , covering all aspects of food products from farm to table .	0.28899054098640264
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .	5.616867204603966
The new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminants and residues , novel food , additives , flavourings , packaging and irradiation .	2.4984780283048046e-06
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers , farmers and food operators , traceability of feed , food and ingredients , proper risk analysis through , for instance , risk assessment - that is , scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is , regulation and control - risk communication , and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate .	0.0011089174909623234
As regards the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon .	0.35534755871456825
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .	4.990438887044659
However , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , I recognise that this was not feasible .	0.01604569938127891
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority .	6.962026529475696
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority .	6.468128034102515
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .	11.851831528989296
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis .	10.293918332899526
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .	5.840576887649319
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .	8.677646210607612
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views , I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .	0.727535481357819
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .	6.854724158031063
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime .	5.848421902450739
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead .	8.311993809597132
It is essential that we get the mix right .	24.348168904609178
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement .	0.003810483589623946
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament .	0.4375038072627712
That is very much the right approach .	31.499787522772948
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight .	13.945412673514916
I hope that we can thrash this out .	32.61742557187207
We need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .	0.005315739196368996
It is very important that we include liability in that process .	15.35651786967196
That is the one word I am talking about .	14.367277012220521
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .	10.207709180381372
That cannot continue .	134.12697074647537
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .	0.36891333420873046
Mr President , it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .	0.10080995007758992
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .	15.461662998765918
You are unclear about this in your White Paper .	12.59929264779618
What is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?	0.029951372401073283
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?	2.5257647516530097
The final part of my question is as follows : when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States ?	0.049134324118475216
That is another point , i.e . the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper .	0.00026021543903260606
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .	1.673015597756421e-06
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality .	8.432323073673057
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .	0.2775425239758531
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .	7.719747619895471
However , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , I have to ask : if Europe has the safest food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?	0.004026458598559316
Secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States ?	0.03470781530520939
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .	10.26413316204445
Regarding enlargement : what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?	0.04848140520902814
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper .	0.03518011115804756
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .	8.02810942085441
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability .	28.121632106826254
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .	7.546736677431231
Once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .	0.04288137517963649
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .	0.6059141503131021
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .	15.088885523880382
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .	13.256861933205855
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .	0.39390964236324955
At the moment the list is , as I say , a negative list and it is added to as required .	0.009517050661462715
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .	0.3443280611004862
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .	7.508303205476688
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .	13.976515794490084
This is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .	0.4280934146507305
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing , I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way .	1.3731367028719703
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information .	0.267920902087686
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation .	6.898854790675816
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .	9.198709821551951
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .	0.1496157359630949
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .	13.41493331778468
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen .	6.730065175614114
Commissioner , the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .	0.07768871736625314
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the Council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .	0.016493144817742177
Of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extending them .	0.0067636163338832215
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that .	0.8802263455423743
I also welcome the White Paper .	18.463379279077984
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban ?	2.593568362560081
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting .	7.105091476845775
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ?	0.1936421299343473
Mr President , you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery , but you did not mention what that periphery was .	0.0677162578649488
For example , the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .	0.2115869704752649
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers .	0.038165320749124904
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .	5.245083133805901
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?	2.281114583220721
In relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .	0.6260340219062335
In addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .	0.06580663066731895
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .	11.225914161376547
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months .	8.234217394719316
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .	9.064501009558724
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September .	9.337645616677149
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September .	14.582421418295079
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work .	6.237361280252671
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice .	14.790212989033865
But it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .	0.0005636409658630846
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .	11.164100800492534
That is an issue for consideration and discussion .	26.060033315977776
There may be a number of views on that .	24.100887834679003
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board .	6.54190661277368
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nominees or even MEPs themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .	0.10122101733548973
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .	17.59775082894355
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity .	32.02131258042033
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .	10.114581882099872
It must be visible .	118.56586120910542
It must be known .	126.85441747373594
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority .	13.007235238141458
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .	0.042265838827004076
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority .	4.978669065501022
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .	13.813490124909922
It must be visible .	118.56586120910542
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority .	8.65220401838579
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .	16.784902889726947
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end .	6.112174439150491
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level .	24.962314697480288
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level .	0.05229592476568696
That is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .	0.08320733891450462
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .	7.204782059561662
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .	6.582612186328638
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .	0.5059019819063345
Over time , as I said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged .	0.021848585289535195
This situation can be achieved over a period of time .	11.939630619264332
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence .	28.34531472967153
It is something that is earned over a period of time .	10.365362446503573
However , the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council .	0.06499705686159304
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward .	0.06519198590269679
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .	8.654855423356219
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .	8.734926351680741
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .	8.553488873511103
In relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .	0.0023053379201624143
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling .	0.6752186362628801
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues .	0.34427010977248595
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority .	11.215938660154965
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .	5.9315634856965005
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe ! But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority .	0.23708340101901754
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin .	5.4090287415402525
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different .	15.562811364197016
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation .	7.023988362049801
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .	0.3574790733265284
Equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified .	0.06955731637627516
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .	11.727422990120761
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based .	0.025139528012563264
That is my judgement at the moment .	16.421051535079638
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery .	4.6559673077116885
Colleagues , I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda .	0.08360836276039667
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents .	6.631246050352794
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them .	0.354808004014073
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner , and his statement .	0.4913397830919846
As you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .	0.13881788680402687
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions .	7.343728248656196
That concludes the debate .	51.17529818162962
Question Time (Commission ) The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000) .	11.174502087480938
We will examine questions to the Commission .	9.113399068438891
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time .	8.981443713809487
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .	6.894186069286171
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .	14.547096279058104
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time ; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .	0.9185060518010969
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .	14.160647205952197
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .	0.00207007011018622
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .	12.582557365553038
First Part Question No 28 by (H-0781/99) : Subject : Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the Atatrk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .	0.12510784352989013
Turkey's nuclear plans ?	1.0
which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ?	1.3878346215727992
prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan .	0.5397243918134771
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget ?	1.6895247345447348
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission .	5.968087839530995
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu , Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .	0.8215364660166367
According to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .	0.15077606641288283
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting , construction , commissioning , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority .	0.04656953546198254
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .	0.4201147283174926
As Commissioner Wallstrm indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .	1.4541203188846104
In particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .	0.2765745613068693
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana .	0.9045405209756191
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .	9.147624539457857
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material .	8.981594696062489
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .	5.127028567354435
Thank you for your reply .	45.95358261120939
I should like to make the following points : Turkey is now a candidate country .	0.12468839627231693
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2% .	11.560241405686105
At the same time , it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India .	0.03422861364330193
In this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology .	0.5355048180611767
So much for the political aspect .	45.22467351843669
Now to the technical aspect .	67.29627817806292
The safety factor in this type of project , and I am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .	0.1150722478746663
In cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .	0.0010648148356034622
However , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .	0.051481546882602106
In this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .	0.1525030549416522
Therefore , and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union .	0.21077983590173044
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .	6.448563039136049
I have explained the position of the Commission .	9.988560465885016
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .	12.34593751040057
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable .	5.3471171108282
In the case of Turkey it is different .	24.109628987319315
The plant is not yet there .	39.76414356814324
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety .	12.464149821801541
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey .	7.554739003955811
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .	0.7512358484753728
Mr President , the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter ?	0.01817689884000021
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .	16.071282997010652
I do not have these concerns .	60.117306791778475
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament .	1.1712174023666078
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99) : Subject : Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict ?	0.060373141714682554
If not , why not ?	2.3470372322358666e-06
Mrs Wallstrm has the floor on behalf of the Commission .	6.322966156818398
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question .	3.5979074903419956e-06
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action .	11.380017883475906
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study .	11.571302040110414
It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe .	6.237106729913838
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment .	10.20771298175258
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force .	8.184786170609874
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .	7.72752379671037
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net .	8.06864098607434
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .	5.744924426489639
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission .	8.50995223132436
However , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .	0.13083483222244752
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .	0.015039219972416982
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe .	15.446091934866772
A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed .	13.394032078689909
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .	6.3879776381001205
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .	0.0012223806380518478
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .	6.616854050006587
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .	7.787095077475441
This uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .	0.6083120350823
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war .	7.467865812842512
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo ?	0.8073103151932168
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?	2.561386768359597
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question .	3.0178909077901065e-06
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo .	5.374618010895391
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .	6.195728549880302
That is also mentioned in the report .	12.623646426276382
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .	5.4730146269407935
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .	10.917574178308932
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .	0.2483362912343473
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union .	0.07289862668413856
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States , as well as the United Nations and the Commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment .	0.09634828922003166
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .	9.106778369535236
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday .	0.0013443280273354942
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .	7.176937210981387
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?	0.28524278442503537
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to .	5.284529274819037
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .	5.772819195225917
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .	7.41538654194718
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .	9.881472335821268
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .	12.819188148401116
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .	9.986266515161399
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .	8.97633535901363
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?	3.0964670295761088
I cannot answer that question .	38.709217801102
When it comes to medical checks and so on , I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .	0.29310085120811186
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that .	0.10616774497161764
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .	11.127084985579877
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99) : Subject : Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .	0.13279011270419155
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .	7.056500759628804
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet .	6.064337633342494
The Tibet Intergroup , therefore , gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet , calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue .	0.1515302505883058
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet ?	1.843221755074067
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .	5.481007818950473
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared .	16.463139952999697
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including Tibet , firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities .	0.022296280416864996
The European Union did that at the European UnionChina Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues , including Tibet .	0.4132928934041922
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .	9.553178896899237
I urge the Chinese again to do so .	12.337521643097988
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities .	12.15216542220172
We are also doing a number of other things : in the European Union-China human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to Tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for Tibetans .	0.003901580971404398
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .	4.959112303617038
But for my part , I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .	0.15842815173765512
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile .	6.912541587925273
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .	0.3098103161988482
Mr President , Mr Patten , of course , you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China , and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto .	0.001035179651154018
However , if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP " , that is , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter .	0.0020685791298121876
Your approach , which I am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .	0.0021167478068000447
Imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .	0.0022857777311224266
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this , then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .	0.5239318551579841
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council .	0.05807632839338511
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is .	10.794803657617223
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council .	4.697289208413081
As it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the Council makes the appointment .	0.002014221388472621
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .	9.344038051907544
Putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .	0.04045506745184778
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union .	0.36307609984786066
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world .	4.028188339631326
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet .	15.664985609932268
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest .	0.8976453129488481
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member , who I recognise is interested in these subjects , I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of Tibet .	0.005578416918758455
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness .	0.00433329657117305
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , serenity , compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans .	0.05972643132408272
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?	0.03127279251717745
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people .	8.346172426149518
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition .	7.325616306921722
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama .	10.413069172089637
It is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .	0.2865702896364049
The Commission , like others , has urged dialogue .	4.531458913214194e-06
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .	10.581105501816602
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama .	6.81673587395348
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China , the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .	0.3070465096297878
It would be very beneficial , not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .	0.2648052445516268
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99) : Subject : Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports , the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Sderman for a citizens ?	0.00666328353393167
right to proper administration in the EU .	10.371322895274629
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .	0.10702614319886473
Are these reports accurate ?	1.1486983167456868
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration ?	0.19055383404721
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it ?	0.45301630122806563
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .	5.481007818950473
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .	8.964310176360936
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure .	5.723439937615557
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .	0.32986726930902904
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .	13.223012303778457
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code .	6.678437272435197
The Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman .	0.04433453318434976
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public .	7.067492545197918
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities .	6.893071850483929
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office .	9.636634028410676
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself .	7.207024296227938
However , it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .	0.6101440400792534
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .	0.002583272213118094
However , I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .	0.04610020401808889
The newspaper reports were misleading .	57.521673801319245
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman .	15.759827701382255
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that .	8.327863999064665
I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .	0.008051992142684315
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .	9.094722090382898
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer .	12.866446515600805
For safety ' s sake , I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the Commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of Jacob Sderman ' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable .	0.030247022632116104
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?	2.9101262549345166
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true ! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999" .	5.58905289502918
Both documents , that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft , cover largely the same ground .	0.0014607988694624538
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .	11.571302471384685
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue .	5.844683402371835
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind .	0.315341550086569
As the author is not present , Question No 32 lapses .	0.04873040010759269
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy .	15.921788588917416
I am sorry .	100.82270951514641
According to the Rules of Procedure , you are not required to reply .	0.04310879159142642
I wish you a good evening .	41.220189521724
Second Part Questions to Mr Nielson , who is replaced by Mr Patten Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , Mr Nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives .	0.028978217398909
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called induction courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , I admit , on a regular basis .	0.00507023547664138
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .	8.42273938397422
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .	13.394041700228856
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .	6.009583636417972
As far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .	0.040858755226659604
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on .	5.496340859581967
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels .	7.232247330249713
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on " .	14.423957706886485
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .	0.6278098648538368
In addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .	0.025430010396489285
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .	0.1591129468663914
It would appear that we are in agreement about this .	16.704832839150967
However , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers .	0.166504963731341
If the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .	0.3265384519682143
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .	0.04408656567530639
Only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .	0.05976690883301762
That is naturally unacceptable .	89.70024489503936
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?	2.8965645588672917
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .	0.455989283688976
This limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .	0.009032397735254655
As I point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .	0.0016468970008653501
My question is this : is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development ?	0.07168548775514905
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson .	7.311357597616494
I must not go on about books , but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back millennia .	0.08474658223878415
Secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential .	0.1020659684683536
And , since it should be essential , I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .	0.012533135085443875
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority .	15.921786907639055
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .	5.722819386920113
Thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .	0.7715539675125422
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said .	8.90386416740623
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .	7.2857049819356865
Since 1991 , the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia .	0.0723927121382784
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme .	11.358882679926465
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million .	0.005592799384626814
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .	0.0009983831318662146
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .	0.4451045769131951
In addition to national programmes , the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .	0.01248660311307282
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind .	0.32242238639575166
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , Tajikistan .	0.06297670814070351
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .	0.04491330713532394
Over the same period , Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million .	0.047193218497611676
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office , ECHO , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan .	0.021853696269095814
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .	0.0012609272388382528
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .	6.1508998510942545
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century .	0.004246220685478966
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular .	7.720120141382809
That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going , that is , with regard to political relations that is .	0.03202888327612273
Of course , that falls within your remit ; my next question falls within Mr Nielson ' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation , in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures , which are the cause of great aridity .	0.005680745460402242
We were able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics .	0.023048564876981256
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .	16.276842391128962
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics .	0.0613822762188095
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side .	8.526480883618246
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia .	8.667486242245898
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well .	11.257327612957425
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible .	1.6233987482238788
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .	7.798414892262804
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .	13.048082675350097
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation .	9.656518423836074
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land .	5.7045643917852376
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .	12.121565601407701
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner ' s answer .	7.765762488383796
This is not the usual state of affairs .	21.532626982692044
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time .	9.943054003707132
Thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your interventions today .	0.00013496339917893718
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99) : Subject : Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment , Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies .	0.046533596723384814
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability ?	1.9385805585506264
have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with .	5.44521620705984
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges , or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies , and , in addition , that there are no exact employment figures .	0.010013267536989726
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment , and what these commitments are ?	0.2222086590633406
Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing , recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?	0.04521466095832354
As far as Mr Papayannakis ' question is concerned , in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment , the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment .	0.06562163422626095
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services , where problems exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment .	0.1615871270682491
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : "Yes to Work " and "Back to Work " .	0.32291219089642315
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .	7.069968639856009
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed , firstly , to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece , secondly , to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and , thirdly , to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies .	0.010538592307438994
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006 , which is being financed from the Social Fund , both the resources and the policies should be used , with the Commission ' s support , to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier .	0.007357298725583894
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made .	7.01674208984515
Thank you , Commissioner for your reply .	0.0004729147300577848
However , our current situation is as follows : at 11.3% , we have the second highest unemployment in Europe , which was not previously the case , we have the biggest increase in unemployment , we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed , i.e . less than 1% of GDP , while other countries , such as France , Belgium and Germany spend 3-4% , and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used , inter alia , to combat unemployment .	0.0
You tell me that you , as the Commission , have made recommendations .	0.00026164902679116925
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .	9.58972360358394
However , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?	0.0013207623634780112
Did anyone find work ?	1.148698087156608
How many people found work ?	1.4142132220674668
If you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .	0.1082250375605143
What has been done about training ?	1.8957535333212756
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees ?	2.108743868953974
Do we have any figures ?	1.5130816005381285
In other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece ?	0.04259730283170107
Mr Papayannakis , the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned , and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies .	0.2187513376175688
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as I can see , an increase in productivity .	0.01235155312103554
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .	16.03867792278961
As you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .	0.07997833754530127
They concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long-term unemployed .	0.017025462747079414
The Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006 .	0.07100368127492705
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99) : Subject : Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy ?	0.10657750775717041
The Danish pension scheme , the Efterln , only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire .	0.025919889339364267
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire .	14.588364310764877
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law .	5.0634776517967595
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however , still pending before the Council .	0.1732610568123341
There is , as yet , no European Court case law on Efterln , but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality .	0.00648804145516721
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .	5.813398020953241
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark .	6.872420344604056
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission , but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been .	0.610592591256152
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission .	6.763004089556741
The Commissioner also more than hinted , of course , that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions , due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system .	0.06724127489419494
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate .	0.6318269842255219
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question .	8.193952843590047
Honourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law .	0.213430324108625
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who , as things stand , have a right to this pension .	0.054261149397841275
Briefly , just to follow on from that last point , I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections , such as they are , would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme , but simply that the Commission has a concern , which it has the right to have under Community law , to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify .	0.005921104934298092
I think that the answer is brief and clear .	22.75289352681337
Of course it is as you say .	19.547355875569824
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark , that is not where the problem lies .	0.14337316912038212
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark .	13.28494343988363
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99) : Subject : Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection , equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive , for non-consultant hospital doctors , who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN) ?	0.00745286243180242
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors .	7.48549476246213
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .	0.0018219017112069801
The Council , Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .	0.09710725358048918
Parliament has proposed 4 years , the Commission 7 and the Council 13 .	0.06446376065545759
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .	9.97592692491446
Although there is this disagreement , I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe .	0.8801672101726793
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99) : Subject : Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming) .	0.11154092402238143
Which Commissioners are members of this group ?	1.681790508166659
How many meetings of the group have been held to date ?	2.118909653816087
What concrete measures have been discussed ?	1.5746091464303726
This question covers several individual matters .	34.66191384618033
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality .	10.212793030567205
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi , Vice-President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself .	0.0010688134344640885
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000 .	8.184824916989292
Three serious issues were discussed : the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women , of which I gave an initial evaluation , the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science , and the third involved Mr Kinnock , who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community .	0.03487274094493438
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your reply , although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the greatest importance .	0.0013922969200973094
We trusted this Commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .	0.009020779976917383
I hope that , in the future , things will change and meetings will become frequent , because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women .	0.0033311033028894533
Mrs Avils-Perea , that was an exhortation rather than a question .	0.004578387933924375
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions .. .	0.06762539127833901
Allow me to say just one word .	30.05366726383344
I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .	0.01757912709105256
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99) : Subject : Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999 , the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative , the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers .	0.011968519206596605
Under this umbrella , each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country .	0.3514319101109424
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States ' programmes ?	2.766475670250611
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?	2.494289902264738
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro .	9.760836187571051
As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States , what will Greece's contribution amount to ?	0.04077423263644866
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .	10.668459702056623
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .	14.338836633459128
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .	0.49112703644147093
This is an important aspect of this initiative .	24.74151805838075
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation .	13.318144870939868
This is the same as the Social Fund regulation , i.e . EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation .	0.0034491549664355313
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament ' s opinion next month .	15.327538356495745
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy .	8.131248990327869
The Member States , i.e . the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .	0.00016455726367849754
Within the European Commission , the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control , the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors .	0.011383085921915984
The last question concerns the amount granted .	32.60741449420988
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million .	27.26800558284636
The contribution commitment is 80% , rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote Greek islands , and a contribution by Greece of 15% .	0.005666270554119985
Mr President , I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non-transparent structure .	0.00018238602549434634
For example , one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .	0.019047356899512785
At the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures , as these are the only structures which can meet such demands .	0.02262520042258157
However , this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas .	0.3742594362120647
However , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is rendered impossible or merely symbolic .	7.018320462989188e-05
Finally , if you consider the overall amount , which is on the small side , - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are , I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing .	0.006000667784450968
First let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament , if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account .	0.11790512359364819
Secondly , I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .	0.014496956735528999
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like Greece .	0.06881948859054704
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission .	30.80821677652379
To encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistics , to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination .	0.0012449207064475938
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups , between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences ; that is mainly what we are looking for , and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated .	0.05253331906565869
This is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .	0.037501410381473095
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99) : Subject : Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art .	0.06729311373388742
4.2) .	1.0
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU ) likely to be effected by such an exemption ?	2.0509244927678014
A month ago , the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribed in the Treaty , in order to implement Article 13 .	0.0019814769338079904
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .	7.150338738872884
At the Commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , Member States and the European Parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .	0.03204974997227278
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .	9.304297216742638
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .	15.088154202301276
In a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .	0.642567088658486
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about .	10.793542711469103
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .	6.099333813743936
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .	30.36622873917274
For instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian .	0.04184376325938211
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .	12.737386876720263
Surely what we should be doing , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice , no matter how sincerely held .	0.0018892106467425054
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mentioned , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .	0.007256914784012229
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .	5.925118058577766
In other words , it is positive discrimination .	0.006680677056739045
In the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic .	0.1740078944346975
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .	21.01894325805871
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99) : Subject : Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions , and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on , in terms of either finance , entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities , living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line , what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment ?	0.011860073672985751
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women , or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies ?	0.3284449069349631
Obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy .	0.038129999534661244
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .	7.72888937774435
The aim of these regional policies , which , of course , are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State , i.e . each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme , is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women .	0.00024508422652918935
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006 , i.e . EUR 195 billion , will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe .	0.0015202689435842819
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created , I would like to say , first , that there is , via the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement , i.e . special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources .	0.00048727687196228355
Secondly , the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions .	0.16556075093437234
Commissioner , thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer , which has been rigorous and well-argued .	0.0037552281202910226
However , I can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions .	0.01837977921340475
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .	0.6058343272142526
Therefore , my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits , which have brought results in cooperation , could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions , who have the odds stacked against them .	0.006304792247791453
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .	18.1581231299907
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .	13.290282816824696
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development , we will not promote , as we should , employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions .	0.01590657069007681
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies .	15.632348042211557
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99) : Subject : Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme , setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue' .	0.15948618576880524
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?	2.151361784199242
We estimate that the Commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .	8.325322703925048
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament , the social partners and non-governmental organisations .	0.03796102582967088
These discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon .	0.16992494679342493
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .	0.5931520663972196
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission ' s social programme .	11.639680665290657
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission , after the Lisbon conference , so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted .	0.12166211986337398
Clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .	4.7187347573199125e-05
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question , namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry ?	0.3319034937239649
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .	7.546430208149689
Firstly , I agree with you entirely .	0.009194583974228177
Account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which I too mentioned .	0.1081585308957212
Social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .	0.009107784424115337
Secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .	0.19744182583479686
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , as you know , is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty .	0.13556342426561074
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99) : Subject : Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty , it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union .	0.031790887751405844
However , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .	0.03399387965596507
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?	2.126431343907811
On 26 November 1999 , the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .	0.08514113169892477
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .	0.03235009138428893
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .	0.10038736793030587
Of course , it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement .	0.03984378969514713
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , coaches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them .	0.0973392802994734
In addition , you should know that , on 4 June 1998 , the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs , the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe .	0.02397642771873954
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer .	27.479057074755648
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe .	6.416095222831878
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage .	4.920644377316822
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan .	11.560254618709838
It is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability .	0.024515167851061764
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them .	0.8741298267838793
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .	0.4420182869418371
It has not yet been passed by the Council ; it is at the consultation stage .	0.07147962723967362
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level .	9.808346173838247
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport .	10.730596346735544
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .	0.03074716995039177
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00) : Subject : Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark , even though the deadline has passed .	0.012589297362895123
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .	5.866071081761207
Pursuant to Article 3(8 ) of the Directive , terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers ' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory' .	0.7950544421892694
However , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .	0.27382538292207514
There are therefore two possible solutions : either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark , or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .	0.025756661370599655
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements .. .	0.33593118961040197
declared universally applicable ' (cf .	52.098751059132084
Article 3(1 ) are concerned , given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law ?	0.035851514193340164
If not , will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area ?	0.010560735475618949
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country .	5.090784950854249
What it says it that one of two things may apply , i.e . either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector .	0.05931085772863812
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules , provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that , apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation , the hours in universally applicable collective agreements , concluded by the most representative organisations , also apply to posted workers .	0.008209865676110522
In other words , to put it simply , Denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .	0.009480769952569352
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark , and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation .	0.46055422610474384
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission ' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply .	9.057751459001427
We are waiting to see what the next move will be .	8.786579877158157
Thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements .	1.0079271360488584
It is a very clear answer , but it is also an answer , may I point out , which puts Danish organisations , the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very , very difficult situation politically , for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model , which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements , and the Continental model , which presupposes legislation .	0.0013045247332118082
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer , Commissioner , concern , first and foremost , another directive , namely the working time directive , but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend , or has expressly stated that it does not wish , to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements .	0.0006519838625587473
Firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country .	0.20604331821557437
As I said earlier , there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another .	0.5551833702637616
As far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to Denmark .	0.13317394515705316
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending .	27.006991683350122
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage .	8.877754115822531
What now needs to be done , and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government , and with other governments , is to find the best way forward , so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States , and which constitutes a general framework , can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries .	0.005114862496051767
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move .	8.922660071300362
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your dedication .	6.478281216809464e-05
You have fulfilled your objective for today , which is to answer all the questions .	0.05475226610835757
We congratulate you .	167.0861172957898
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing .	0.34943901651326714
That concludes Question Time .	62.19466540802253
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m . and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) 1997 discharge The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000 ) by Mrs van der Laan , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament , II - Council , III - Commission , IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors ) [SEC(1998 ) 520 - C4-0350/1998 , SEC(1998 ) 522 - C4-0351/1998 , SEC(1998 ) 519 - C4-0352/1999 ] The Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , is not here yet , but I hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minutes .	0.0
Nevertheless , I recommend that we start , in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech , from her office , if that is where she still is .	0.0007727934434174199
Mr President , I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise .	0.18109294076607962
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation .	0.34622137747969883
Mr President , early last year , the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future .	0.028095537985673463
In its resolution , this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious , far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission .	0.03459576913835798
This report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock ' s reforms .	0.00011573376508746502
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans .	10.976726487630525
In the period leading up to this , it already appeared , on the basis of the initial drafts , that the Commission had made very important pledges .	0.0021026567874637483
We asked for a whistle-blower ' s regulation , and this is now in place .	0.06715687396558075
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .	11.536276269218575
This has now been done .	42.25252805540071
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets .	14.267000299073619
This is in place too .	83.86163818987829
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges .	23.3405314206616
It did this as well .	33.086764837294695
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000 .	12.211192382979046
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices .	16.922612684965166
These are sound , first steps which illustrate that , if this Parliament so wishes , changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly .	0.004633523255779225
We want more than that , however .	0.003237924024554944
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .	13.281280181218396
This is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen .	0.3700035936371046
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points .	11.42839361421146
Firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents .	0.03487108691715919
This , however , presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .	0.02720651641510835
In the context of providing information , I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents .	0.7095356371563947
If the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today .	0.16677040251620967
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .	5.329196011814142
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .	8.574658438379197
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful .	5.025532854925117
Furthermore , it should be the case that , if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running , the management should be held responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chances of promotion .	0.0058465779662388835
Ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts .	0.0005308392312287196
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year .	5.157372806953296
It should no longer be the case that , although Europe is an economic power , we have no political influence because , when the chips are down , we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it .	0.0035641625977551714
I would quote Gaza as an example .	16.954422531801207
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left unused .	0.013264805257531402
Mr President , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .	4.088719485294552e-06
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .	10.106930311763081
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .	16.019751216259838
However , we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .	0.09226817454248736
Indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up .	0.3312687041530858
Finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission .	0.022142593613652915
But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order .	6.531544715568365
As long as we have no status , we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union .	0.17189107300145268
The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe ' s development process .	13.36733077450891
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic .	9.443611786291527
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe .	9.308812377611904
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .	0.19648833038922528
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in Europe .	0.0653057542505747
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .	8.532080746757355
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them .	8.326090763806043
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes , particularly in third countries , without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing .	0.06258003953041143
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .	0.20787312530450033
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources .	9.56120247619584
That cannot excuse everything that we came across .	17.056189505664722
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .	7.78391856405882
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock .	6.692017036896044
From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good .	0.08329122544690244
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today , I heard some of what he had to say .	0.13369659594780683
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .	6.344776907541916
But we need that reform process .	30.214124791892978
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report .	7.549507980685462
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .	14.556471219033853
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .	0.39455188125026974
It groups them together and that is very important .	13.419677417208364
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to .	9.932470381039986
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe .	19.155634751679347
We have to get this right .	46.88082899133947
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly .	12.420020255947659
We have to remedy that .	83.86168689704947
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .	32.053648855436215
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .	13.152686244321231
We need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .	0.31050077022603884
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible .	8.390294934231846
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue .	0.052744658929070286
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .	10.57561022217712
Mr President , I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which , as you are all so very well aware , led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission .	0.02554051165202305
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge .	16.957265930510033
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well .	12.842257053593652
But that is not to say that we are satisfied , and that everything in the garden is rosy .	0.22195919293061497
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue .	18.503336119687443
It indicates , however , that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction .	0.0008066740348301579
I just want to outline some of the issues that we , as Socialists , have put down as amendments .	0.00427499618472557
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform .	10.210067604205419
First of all , the immunity of officials : this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor .	0.0074836915501290775
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption .	10.296223876467412
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors .	5.912170479066418
The Court's report is there for a reason , our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through .	0.4550671526464009
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission .	6.822038756953704
Even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .	0.3486107541590953
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them .	6.141623693392378
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future .	17.12621948448526
The other issue is access to confidential documents .	18.280371156357173
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had .	8.676562217528605
We understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential .	0.45013611850982393
We have put down an amendment to that effect .	20.485956635055096
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital .	9.132688747691999
The situation there is totally unacceptable .	37.79909111948028
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue .	7.609991757830243
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan .	19.98671111552994
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks .	8.018816875850478
Mr President , Commissioner , if we are honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .	5.226839529684175e-05
We are discussing last year ' s discharge , but also the Commission ' s responsibility .	0.1169069043801233
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks .	13.739356290130438
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .	6.029152110182477
It is about a Commission which is no more .	18.361693605201857
There is now a new Commission .	26.075111174630308
Then it is logical to grant discharge , because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned ?	0.04993127892243494
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .	18.060279279463604
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission ' s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions .	0.41943444761784904
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month .	17.056191058516397
We are all very much anticipating this , but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .	0.4735043870362226
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled .	17.68765340147453
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed .	18.80567209055865
Take , for example , the pledges made by the Commission .	4.965384045391969e-05
They look good in themselves .	42.73844593265334
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them .	8.608391423290568
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .	0.8652444645346873
The previous speaker already said something about this .	13.81136682782831
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .	0.016261513738869575
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results .	10.699193227702205
This also applies to whistle-blowers .	71.30949252106609
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but , at the same time , it is entirely unclear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example , happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament .	0.0038930943968938387
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .	7.817553704417895
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made .	5.694306686295927
This also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced .	0.002061662048822415
In my opinion , the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposals .	0.08558885350634239
At the moment , our group still feels sympathy for , and patience with , the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past , but this patience has a limit .	0.003514494831656572
Clear progress must be visible .	52.09875219493347
At present , we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so .	0.013715431832320145
Finally , Mr President , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission .	0.0026875094932803365
I express the hope that - in fact , I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission .	0.45484938623521537
Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value .	18.212939295808045
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .	0.09252771610267696
In our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .	0.3146993704060923
In that year , we voted against granting discharge .	0.01959874168856486
As a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .	0.0007341437971604239
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors .	6.361745721951507
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .	11.571302984817356
So far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .	2.605705447487945e-05
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .	0.32529510669581446
Mr President , first of all , I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan ' s very expert work on this report .	0.007066674423934428
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .	7.184486911810462
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .	7.77007495523838
We support these critical remarks , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .	0.004518599096823763
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor ' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful , and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we , as Members of this Parliament , were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned .	0.1067550177909248
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission ' s implementing a series of reforms , so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission ' s period of office is not repeated .	1.1071368883998596
Again , I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission ' s accountability for the future .	0.6596622921543516
We do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .	0.006419511919332553
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission ' s liability as an institution .	13.661907634204171
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better .	0.4220969168990332
By means of this extraordinary procedure , Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs , namely with the previous Commission .	0.03478543232211826
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating .	0.18467238655392257
There is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .	0.0018047983199488665
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .	0.002274110261204854
Mr President , the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission , to whom it was to be granted , had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity .	0.020230344858008256
Mrs van der Laan ' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work , and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997 .	0.7496508193615542
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor ' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , 1996 , was denied .	0.11560536017217911
That is just the way things are , however .	0.011301818335062932
In taking over the mandate , the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made .	0.377249230052016
Since , on account of the college system , discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or , alternatively , denied or postponed , it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged , crop up again as Members of this body .	0.00412902654282149
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed .	13.678271139090727
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .	0.7674952448483421
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan ' s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .	0.02968197550465457
The comments contained within , under eight headings , are an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision .	0.003137071089766707
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997 .	0.17966549629840364
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme .	11.182271896019635
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis-vis the discharge authority .	0.0146214197527068
Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform .	0.16316786293909372
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .	8.90436790449006
It is fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament .	0.029568439966987804
However , the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives .	1.1121449748243812
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .	0.0023115279209178644
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate .	6.53571641283523
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that , as the European Commission is reformed , it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission .	0.08217461854131003
Mr President , the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it .	0.0035382652750135563
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability .	0.01413686707156063
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission ' s remit .	10.297845539200726
The new Commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals , and I must admit that I am not impressed at all .	0.005036047377727524
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists .	7.156093188491396
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start .	7.628006723611721
I do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly .	0.007522361754119383
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO .	16.145803776877116
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter .	7.473645362406048
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information .	0.6427465888814955
From the outside , it looks as if the Commission has something to hide .	0.13530233320963905
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .	9.801980549306235
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission .	4.527401696112628
It was this practice which led to the Commission ' s downfall .	19.822751149793124
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents .	8.938826527756422
Otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .	0.010454718313923379
Thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .	2.4217539493748203e-05
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000 ) by Mr van Hulten , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission .	0.03495931550819626
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the European Commission .	0.036669470617274595
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that : "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility" .	0.3550133922472199
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team .	8.67793956782764
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal .	6.291527201595291
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office .	0.01245474561964741
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform , which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today .	0.7543296515828147
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function .	8.722178095587603
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .	7.5843552670847725
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer goods .	0.019770662314256063
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .	9.653645948330459
The number of departments has been reduced .	22.345606900595723
The Commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated .	0.007291778301564466
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong , honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels ; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential .	0.14728196643962743
In order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .	0.04605100436349616
First , financial management and control within the Commission must be improved .	0.06962834364142134
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .	9.103784745966456
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .	0.13286120204444773
A new independent audit system service must be set up .	10.146464896476385
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities .	4.968495250228795
In return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .	0.23968926679358085
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .	10.764689473617441
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes .	8.552024455969901
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia .	0.5886212410294837
Urgent change is required today .	57.521687130167024
Second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive .	0.001405217369699421
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud .	0.5548619636259777
OLAF , the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts , criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions .	0.2607256791132554
A proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , by the middle of this year .	0.0012185160222270492
Third , standards in European public life must be upheld .	0.027758967123763485
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct .	6.499863040422879
A number of codes have since been introduced .	23.013616456553077
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding .	13.322174832954378
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries , most notably the United Kingdom , and institute a committee for standards in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions .	0.027948447723600976
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected .	13.25686229129274
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers .	10.816753907107044
They must be implemented without delay .	46.59677351679744
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong .	0.24523336618771943
Crucially , reforms must not be limited to the Commission .	0.026112958182038536
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules , administrative procedures and management practices .	0.21219090532869694
Finally , the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised .	0.027805570452617157
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern , multinational organisation .	0.06500290032401528
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .	7.41600945723402
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive .	22.96533834550382
Too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .	0.09052717563538176
Merit must be recognised and rewarded , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .	0.3553376885401073
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .	14.953656119941684
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .	8.839410465130477
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .	12.190254921132
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements ; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders , or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States .	0.3160317509287482
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .	0.0001957868757898846
This communication must contain a clear timetable .	25.246759768660805
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be .	3.908891111831362
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away .	32.025886748916015
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order ; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .	0.4176345659106992
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism .	5.613848095687601
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories .	24.35764591512041
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .	17.05618116766834
Mr President , I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am , of course , in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate , necessary reforms .	0.003547643447512746
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis , but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points , in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we are talking about .	0.0046432488304648115
All the experts can provide information and news , formulate opinions and give advice , but , they have no political or elective responsibility , and rightly so .	0.00033715647009636333
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which , on some occasions , I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive .	0.1417395702523697
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone , and no one else , can exert an influence over its Members .	0.051839776266791635
If this were not the case , the European Parliament ' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years , and this institution would not move forward , as it should .	0.005997332952829736
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation .	8.192776507292722
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .	0.039856373699946324
I would point out that there is no European legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each Member State .	0.19636865001830645
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .	9.129278531195895
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced , but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and , in any case , the equal need for the right to a defence .	0.026118954557718337
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat : whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium .	0.49278525878715196
In conclusion , Mr President , Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers , not go into reverse .	0.0003042815735253829
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957 .	8.307589042287589
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , are now part of European folklore .	0.12547366708078886
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated .	5.577083759435925
Remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March .	0.07822802186581554
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September .	6.126935788993909
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored .	12.371979319506803
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials .	6.72102770446032
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .	0.36458497912432875
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly .	5.929650249406194
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .	0.31672688092161566
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information .	5.8452838005512655
This was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission .	0.00048456253255184514
Have the lessons not been learnt ?	1.345899877912692
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .	5.947081925397678
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .	0.05645763121172874
The less precise , Mr van Hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like .	0.008475032343417767
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented .	6.771663577562217
We have , as the EPP-ED group , submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee .	0.022022554608568317
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion .	0.008173444588889616
Looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission .	0.29438801316796315
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .	5.242409040089074
Commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred .	0.16272630087827147
In a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .	0.1216433195098235
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .	9.863839524246684
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .	8.282991122655304
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions .	6.1678039947716705
But , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination .	0.06640287923719032
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform .	6.039931742726001
Mr President , I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation .	0.07266442725564534
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report .	12.299301889573258
It is an excellent report .	36.06602668092421
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .	4.230847472316047
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced .	10.75413674951348
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse .	9.775356219317933
Yes , a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .	0.06736875306272845
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far .	10.454716505722336
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .	10.94904802751521
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .	18.719261517132793
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission .	6.840389641009978
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation .	14.038012567715679
That is important .	88.49079947398941
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another .	12.032238275061017
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .	14.601906832541266
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .	16.878157939889316
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission .	5.988711405048698
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .	0.35340839831326487
I will give you one example of this .	11.497284355953875
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million .	5.626257163600075
It is clear that is not acceptable .	35.766715570805715
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?	1.9804597973660654
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .	10.21679313854605
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working .	17.451357824035604
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .	20.89861493710163
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because , unlike what Mr Elles has just said , the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March .	0.1762440709678128
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones .	11.137222814933216
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .	8.963839462816821
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .	17.31277805024657
Our own staff policy is outdated .	34.66191810688015
Some of our working practices need radical reform .	20.998630974079777
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process .	11.383839992412048
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting .	25.24675684891333
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities .	6.139379262126292
Finally , can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .	0.1413968701123002
European taxpayers need to be re-assured .	59.75325512288883
The fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rests on delivery of this reform .	0.0018832312219709724
That is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .	0.03320438026222119
Mr President , I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur , Mr van Hulten , on his first report .	0.0003732585817503823
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments .	6.847844584310199
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run .	5.230494070399514
We have submitted an amendment to this effect .	20.752666894441504
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report , I would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly .	0.036000028917451174
Firstly , I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents .	0.21283297901639311
The Commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .	12.72133879773676
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair , which , as it happens , has still not been sorted out .	0.00107179628448071
Curiously , very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets , even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General , and this is clearly something which should not happen .	0.007632565909198395
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections , these documents must be available , and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation .	0.05379384668481889
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .	8.435934658704365
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report .	12.186941606559753
I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .	6.731629425145565
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad .	9.156617641969376
It is clear that , over the past couple of years , we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure .	0.018389602455897824
Is this possible ?	1.0
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out .	6.47402851261139
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first .	9.464288338688318
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten .	0.006893232951885033
It is his first report here in plenary .	15.913987697397141
This is worth a compliment although I regret , of course , that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue .	0.006509357073315334
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .	11.168351960107588
In my opinion , this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control .	0.17855897439114332
Let us be honest .	89.70024099393993
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September .	13.339680032866664
We are now four months down the line .	20.998614323289342
Meanwhile , Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .	0.0089903880139741
He went back to work , rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions , but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round .	0.05225861321454224
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .	0.3609766382422094
Moreover , I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament , I hope .	0.12122518803729421
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?	3.0044008229402124
Mr van Hulten , my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to embellish this report .	0.2783071905742739
After all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report .	0.1474143926656708
So tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs , this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable .	0.037327156356757686
In any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men .	0.0011428127923143498
In any event , I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today .	0.14089363088524698
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February .	16.079983588810922
I have to inform you , Commissioner , that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group , gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not .	0.04438381966326634
I would like to end on the following point .	26.235142854783085
Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated , we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission .	0.6737848809858933
I think that there is a need for this , as public opinion is looking for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .	0.014555937249263106
Mr President , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .	1.684269559700011e-05
Fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .	0.03657421041778033
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow .	9.577503943742844
Via the structural funds , a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system .	0.15178550580061817
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States .	6.193627578898757
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States .	8.626084186331875
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating .	4.763276079728434
After each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control is more pronounced .	0.012955023184193039
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem .	15.159806058282951
It will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects .	0.008046657287723658
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour .	7.237803797446373
In the next couple of years , we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population .	0.6756469347576579
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less overheads , more transparency and more democracy .	0.005770112647035518
Mr President , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .	0.015802241917657705
The first report was widely publicised , formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat , first of the President of the Commission , and then of the majority of the European Commissioners , even though they had no connection with fraud , mismanagement or nepotism .	0.006957365459471772
Reading now what happened then , not even a year ago , it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform , as is maintained today , so much so that this second report - which , on the other hand , could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases , since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report .	0.00770783596191926
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament , nor to the majority of the trade unions , who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration , but , in practice , are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members , putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use .	0.001893717809200996
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee , thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state .	0.4977763888318835
Incomprehensibly , trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition , and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF , thereby placing this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its impartiality , at great risk .	0.0006457173377065356
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time , which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates , discussions and the exchange of information .	0.03230450921166318
Mr President , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation .	0.0038323318423207813
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission .	7.472787927734851
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound , the more applause they receive .	0.30657111226052025
There again , it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen , and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks .	0.08183464094170106
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue .	5.7255467926520245
Nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report .	0.05405004270754134
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points .	0.8751969047016681
Allow me to start with the most important demand .	33.61452609111289
We do not want financial control to be abolished .	24.285874731343927
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever uncertainties or risks arise .	0.040338027730027
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here , by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits , for example .	0.016145745198344146
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission ' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .	0.8664181063944483
I do not have exact figures , but the Community ' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office .	0.154590247821953
This cannot be ignored or evaded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee .	0.021612503149324013
Irrespective of such legal considerations , it would be an unforgivable mistake , under the circumstances , to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are , at long last , no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms .	0.012562587479969661
As we see it , there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF , the new anti-fraud office .	0.005542182027050066
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled .	0.634988581277707
A few salient points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours , including those of a financial nature .	0.008100311045541845
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague .	0.6835455171511476
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked .	11.724099479238326
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , Mr van Hulten .	0.001700285732793639
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am , I think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .	0.03140432036954322
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .	14.73248507050062
Mr President , the Commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .	0.10132911162210768
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one .	8.376051069369064
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent .	4.956007708664445
Sometimes , an enormous reservoir of money is created , not because it is not desperately needed , not because there are no sound proposals , but because the whole system has collapsed .	0.0016521039960196316
A lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .	0.0012336203465599805
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .	0.3259528132527774
When the Commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March , I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .	0.5889749298725736
Without any doubt , this will then be a service , Mr President , to the European public and , by means of the results we produce , we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years .	0.001129413481640235
This is the best support we can give to European democracy .	19.26448313563665
If , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century , we are witnessing a very special moment indeed .	0.005511622796075657
Mr President , first of all , congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report .	0.0004138010733274375
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .	0.44759426139544234
Mr van Hulten , I think you deserve a medal for your efforts .	0.04442578939799974
There are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR .	0.0059098498583523545
Firstly , there is the Commissioners ' individual responsibility .	0.013949958083380492
This must be regulated during the IGC .	21.02081835793035
However , we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have , therefore , submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council .	0.13710227566398883
Secondly , as already mentioned by my colleague , Mr Mulder , the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts .	0.00368861917033349
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution .	10.186844170939425
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well .	5.710290970022568
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open , democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve .	0.28281948206371976
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House .	0.11652308663869841
I am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .	0.06456772736163682
At this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission , demanded by our citizens .	0.007463817913118451
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed , even by its Presidents .	0.16417472375955908
It now appears that this desire is more serious .	12.37446303499725
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies , it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised , on 14 September , to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February .	0.040068569035790355
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme .	19.592412943238475
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament .	5.937044731681118
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .	0.04140598325141685
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it is , I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process .	0.0467925199569134
We want a strong Commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .	0.00821603951095224
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .	12.098521982823508
Therefore , the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties .	0.29745799784975085
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise .	25.978423143569678
I do not know your exact view in this respect , Mr Kinnock , but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .	0.025202997761726027
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .	0.30340472588920714
Therefore , Commissioner , we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme , and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat , but not with this Parliament , which expects profound and daring changes .	0.002452257915847919
Mr President , the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line .	0.034060743375537175
Therefore , the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order .	0.45614332099102284
As far as this is concerned , a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis , with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future .	0.26201710203425094
Naturally , this is only to be welcomed .	0.007789010534115694
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to dispense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval .	0.0013730470391236898
Up until now , the Commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .	0.45413589974328167
And so it is the "two key " principle that applies here .	14.512142090768867
A single key is to suffice in future .	14.674412440570027
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission .	0.2955767806992362
If you will pardon me for saying so , Mr Kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes .	0.033083448769031625
What we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .	0.0011819157551469955
This could be achieved by no longer insisting , in future , that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .	0.009584793004733774
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all .	7.36294349284611
Therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .	5.140188235298868e-05
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the operational Directorates-General , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming .	0.00860925312385241
However , the financial controllers must work independently .	0.013606260625054977
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission , when it talks in terms of decentralisation .	0.2303268133087049
It is obviously the Commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General , but this is precisely what we do not want .	0.45184056286695706
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair , when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings , but these were neither heeded nor passed on .	0.05214673422563281
Therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .	0.013900540747553222
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to .	13.27120056381987
Indeed , the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?	0.04224830169004077
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote .	9.856559481460947
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard .	7.147651949859579
Mr President , a couple of years ago , the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .	0.00627299639862534
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise .	0.25271094383252507
This was stupid of the old Commission , and Parliament was of no help on that occasion .	0.08771213819560336
When I read Mr van Hulten ' s passage about personnel policy , I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air .	0.6244569965051606
There are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .	0.12227659317663613
There is no backbone , and no teeth .	0.01729707239901922
Where is the beef ?	1.1486983233143835
And I would also say this to you , Commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is British .	0.00046510594133642146
Romano Prodi promised a revolution .	52.098743762475365
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts ! Sort out the tangle of staff allowances .	0.07427278716210091
Stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .	0.001523084893624843
Ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .	0.0023735040074043556
Do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .	9.639379097516025
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .	6.4109681202557205
Finally , Mr President , as a member of the Bureau until six months ago , I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply , in our own administration , with the demands we are making on others .	0.0025589578480840064
We have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .	0.15619259710370306
Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it .	0.09138234707157383
So I refer to the things I do not agree with .	11.168102917432083
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament .	21.28669437573957
This report is about the Commission .	25.623791058191596
Parliament is a separate subject .	70.11970442119033
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission .	8.207608982315117
In addition to that , there is the question of duty-free .	0.029989043380397415
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports .	6.754459885330368
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either .	19.242799838953978
Most of the report is about financial control .	30.905217356893957
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee .	10.633606278120052
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission .	6.395636121739424
After all , it is only 1% of GDP , by comparison with national spending .	0.0004026317665150764
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States .	4.547263159744472
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money .	8.029268592430972
We should get it into perspective .	34.66192342029989
It is important to remember that .	25.830009919328063
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money .	19.85215716493912
They have very little of it .	24.151460428449518
They have a much wider responsibility .	36.46397468972001
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment , food safety , foreign trade , the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them .	0.005218864748584604
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .	14.889614225437887
If there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year .	0.09169407595128741
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament .	0.08331486953465288
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted , doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs .	0.8786594287488614
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were .	18.306675109038895
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it .	7.2302884144535415
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .	0.41071292415358024
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .	0.02939973900139665
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work .	17.389651105412106
The process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission .	0.19776907684046469
The Commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .	18.68529626183816
Naturally , there are good , capable employees in the Commission , and they are in the majority .	0.00014486250696738918
But we need radical reform .	60.951930001675834
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .	15.034303501070765
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable .	10.083642612428454
The Financial Regulation should be amended .	24.151470141919688
We agree that we should have better control of the finances .	21.017122462859962
It is just a question of how .	27.947173119808614
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .	8.961013634970802
We should be careful about this .	29.03517294701992
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control .	13.023691358945122
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .	11.38615199646196
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .	13.394041234097863
Instead , we should be reforming and decentralising control .	0.017362100524510996
The Commission does not have enough staff .	41.50288214480237
As Members of the European Parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission ' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it .	0.6808744339808382
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs .	7.884527468482648
The staffing system is too rigid .	34.66192236118515
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarchy .	0.14664064354465783
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees .	13.311498819572574
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .	17.469916812237823
After all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .	0.12895859274357888
Mr President , Commissioners , first of all , I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is , on the whole , a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned .	4.796461929715135e-05
Perhaps this is a little worrying .	58.28102710693389
I hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved .	0.013710173738786677
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one .	0.6520819912129316
As Mr Blak said , we must instead establish a system with clear roles .	0.08051487531752458
First of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .	0.0004435995637372207
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough .	11.287218217480198
There need to be tough rules stating , among other things , what may be decentralised , what may be outsourced and what is independent .	0.0021160892636250908
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised .	6.39518398361884
What we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the EU , for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States .	0.0019335474041892644
These are what are missing .	52.09875726726749
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor ' s Office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the EU .	0.18374693156569055
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .	0.06882721732916196
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .	0.08764788087442967
Secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing roles .	0.025261872730506223
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .	0.42860015853513667
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .	28.16349506792651
We do not hunt down criminals .	51.567825270421444
That is OLAF ' s job .	34.66186149923695
Tell me what national parliament , for example , is handed all preliminary investigation documents .	0.0006937356418201523
Obstinate as I am , I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet .	0.4352953274024463
Otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight .	0.028164259906871585
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .	0.04843415133831278
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch , now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so .	0.2537549939852078
Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .	10.008494563120244
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .	0.16797415027165466
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic .	5.162945217477671
I think that this is also the case here , but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .	0.5736965512400134
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Poms Ruiz , who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective .	0.6456134686553535
Mr President , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .	0.0033473502053736975
A very important proposal indeed .	57.521681822987745
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan , because she wants to scrap it altogether .	0.4909693309857507
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .	25.24675699173701
On the one hand , we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but , at the same time , Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well , as a result of which , in fact , the entire content of this report vanishes .	0.002213845786280798
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock , but I happen to know Mr Kinnock .	0.1816696333209105
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary .	6.271407775623994
In my opinion , such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary .	0.05907643781918063
Finally , the issue of officials .	0.003179716414317961
Actually , I do not entirely share Mr Haarder ' s view .	0.045763001453822116
I do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally inadequately .	0.0016795235570472584
First of all , the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised .	0.1261540521463421
Secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .	0.04153054333206152
For example , we are currently looking into TAOs . This is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission .	0.00021590952947911113
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other , and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .	0.23742013456684194
Mr President , ever since Plato ' s 'Republic ' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts .	0.01791881287355088
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .	0.04481395311927604
In this second report , the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament , which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office , since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members .	0.03383716485878531
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups .	6.971353803926941
According to the experts , Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission .	0.10819596771133844
This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life , and this should be a standing committee , not elected , presumably made up of another group of experts .	0.01076585032581901
In this , their second report , the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund , that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing .	0.03395687821742986
They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States .	4.892048711220675
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge .	13.394038149221943
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .	11.846918030545098
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved .	6.489900225968183
Unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .	0.0004858320563097001
Mr President , Mr van Hulten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising , arduous and complex , and I believe this is important in a first report .	0.0004003530887674957
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .	0.6249934131418395
This report seems to me to be redundant , long-winded , confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used .	0.008905137663962734
Perhaps 'redundant ' is the most serious epithet , and you are not responsible for this .	0.09549431192721353
It is the responsibility of this Parliament .	21.38140770826938
That is to say , if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said , but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on , ad infinitum .	0.02513469001935913
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them .	0.6460950703053032
Meanwhile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence .	0.045019636189572734
'Long-winded ' .	1.0
I am not going to mention the length of this report .	11.915979493569845
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .	0.024370743332577046
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop .	6.294282616886824
It is also 'confusing ' .	87.26815720109465
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament .	11.022894633393083
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .	0.3440706712487497
And finally , Mr President , frankly , I am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .	0.00039541651949502214
Therefore - in summary - I await , and many of us await , your report , Commissioner Kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which is the duty of this Parliament .	0.00019762742024554333
Mr President , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are .	0.1039505856585291
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .	0.3639702130008474
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control .	4.364600616689559
The concept of transparency stands out in the report .	12.131120047520835
Securing this is a major priority .	71.2750007842048
The importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .	0.07150639836848774
This is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .	0.00035343002512387836
We must win back their faith in EU politics .	15.921786667573164
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them .	7.049515913784307
This is what enables them to understand what is going on .	12.36184573860973
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served Whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the Commission ' s own initiative .	0.13174537915279225
However , it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis .	0.6010709385410423
However , Mr Kinnock , your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street ; rather , as Parliamentarians , we want , and must , play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week , before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control .	0.0012902438242843074
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations .	0.0022725841835000045
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament ! So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House .	3.8859940960348984
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House , there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full , formally and in detail for everything I have done .	0.1933837680837878
Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report .	0.002342956353962962
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects , certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance , as several Members have said , to all of our Institutions .	0.08777941562898803
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .	7.974665972251352
Mr President , as you will know , Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and , since I want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , I seek your indulgence .	0.002756463988661972
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary .	9.354359428323693
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September , I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals .	0.8074986214086519
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago .	0.6778048580222991
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that .	13.42177968631177
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform .	4.0934625594140766
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile .	8.072150751347927
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance .	6.924087751763779
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode .	13.205371931957398
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing .	0.6330502724212956
Hence the transmission .	191.93154808051537
Though time forbids me , Mr President , from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas .	0.05308856290907914
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations .	13.194716983962119
The need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does .	0.6506573559955693
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public .	0.015673504132285725
Naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .	0.031888778659270936
I have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning .	0.007995000442561377
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission .	7.187255204957062
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .	13.373070228613798
As the House knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures .	0.5648302642448093
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate .	15.226671203409492
We share the view , forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures .	0.06380339907923144
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April .	7.421999719090764
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .	8.50995265320197
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law .	6.0003457773497555
Change in the law is fundamental .	34.66187431856774
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system .	0.9253617669576459
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget .	4.3587529825964655
In addition , and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key " as Herr Bsch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts .	0.04995160120327524
That service will open on 1 May this year .	12.021354516612023
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .	5.264844835892858
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening .	0.06183198731712155
As Budgets Commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors .	0.07706160374549452
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits .	9.589674043126813
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .	9.320213840110322
The proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .	0.3208900999296488
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach" .	9.129626434180956
Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate .	5.494584005759378
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts .	4.741811503481916
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .	11.141051305524503
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .	9.362669166654186
In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 .	0.08396881178313298
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson ' s comments to this House last month .	6.498577777106256
"The Commission's internal control " he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .	7.656056426628357
For instance , the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .	0.10465658642642128
At the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General. " The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions .	0.007688593889509176
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .	10.159730211772926
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .	6.397996784535468
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document .	6.570704680196661
Our objective , the committee ' s objective , the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control .	0.0032105217207690053
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .	5.639925155680887
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing .	0.00782677242090574
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed .	0.8022780133209212
Since June of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .	0.11672812331596875
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .	4.731069635195088
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .	14.952018402138684
We are seeking to implement best practice .	24.45249423042956
Serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure .	0.535930634904813
As a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .	0.17837219615429936
A communication later this year will give full details .	16.519608414009333
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose .	13.131972873363164
I am persuaded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .	0.019587655465312926
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .	0.005385030590306007
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament .	6.589376870455523
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .	10.20770560063188
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House .	8.61024811653844
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .	8.296441820363118
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .	5.820099739153694
That is in line with the draft resolution .	15.321546556903712
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .	5.182333772349976
I welcome Parliament's support for that .	21.724321779489305
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report .	0.4629133908618387
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament .	7.590824763311396
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that .	6.5582660332663485
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .	7.503209234919969
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors .	8.766546836223183
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament .	7.8084050605569315
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .	8.429886995941024
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .	12.9898097672732
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .	8.306544175997379
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals .	0.136422006080767
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .	6.00400604022751
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .	10.725820608569776
Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised Commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made .	0.0003066372926026297
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .	0.23242175974969675
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .	10.152923906287901
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House .	7.803841979792909
It is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .	0.00044895620500188106
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters .	0.04210751693506367
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .	10.318385976991193
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .	6.8926257032559315
That is most certainly relevant .	52.098759868765256
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend " as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .	5.467923697608643
It is very clear , however , that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched .	0.003882328780592538
Parliament has frequently made that point .	25.407088823331502
Secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .	0.15857395103199487
Thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .	0.06199107956925101
They are already having implications for resource availability .	19.592419330283906
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities " and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity .	5.304962180765921
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management .	6.794926200428007
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission .	0.028561025548872576
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report .	11.571299384998817
I conclude , Mr President , by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions .	0.008174995729024383
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities .	0.14526163676339773
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m . (The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m. ) Middle East peace process (continuation ) The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process .	0.015137860472174925
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama ' s insights , as he arrived hot-foot from the region .	0.8903816565699454
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East , even though , as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki .	0.21597338226994872
Such is life .	154.0714306572117
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .	0.058330058864212116
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening .	5.243033130679127
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion .	9.488368290734254
It is not something , I assure you , which I would wish to make a practice of .	0.004765147665610511
Like honourable Members , I welcome the United States ' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations , despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today .	0.09051612632580587
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future .	7.447031301361721
I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours .	4.22393198224382
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .	14.608792587699337
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .	11.760530376407885
A fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East .	0.006652907112560458
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum .	10.193727429995715
Although there has been some slippage , I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon .	0.19790957717549493
Similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline , I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached .	0.18103822174573575
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat , when they met on Monday .	0.26754751301328805
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .	6.3753749301028595
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties .	0.6082790879246841
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .	11.324561226050234
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month .	6.871904271777008
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again .	6.733084501480705
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - Palestinians , Israelis , their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged .	0.00759652269334289
Nor is our role confined to that of banker .	20.238807562938653
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .	9.797093227589157
But we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag .	0.2198965761311123
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments .	14.000585676018785
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon .	10.1780670750829
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process .	7.818227969919913
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians .	13.147265639825331
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Egypt .	0.0019285250095457621
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .	6.885169696276851
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza .	3.9307751869574576
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period .	9.22339878067241
In this context , let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency .	0.21675949576805204
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week .	13.684874572412204
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .	7.119941841765517
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts .	35.05254060377131
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs .	7.304483332270643
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year .	9.475920520565849
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels .	5.559206097809448
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East .	5.3509606597856605
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them , helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights .	0.9981616124789076
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy .	8.671187062363757
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon , the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts .	0.013315368953949
We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole .	6.7743826532480655
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world , numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead .	0.6020749395066723
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources .	6.533739812311461
Lastly , but maybe most importantly , we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas , bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems .	0.010010014837286887
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace .	6.336159257309254
I want to underline that point .	51.685882803953035
I wish insistently to remind the Council and , should it be necessary , Parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing .	0.0104078912072695
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide .	6.2232843888368725
I hope I can add that we will want to provide that .	16.013376078129888
We have made progress in recent months and weeks , as Mr Gama mentioned earlier .	0.08972511705166202
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way .	7.797498414787394
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome .	6.814756367750927
Lastly , I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes , what I said at the outset of my remarks : that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening .	0.04945643632310726
I hope the House will understand that .	21.233261270275037
Mr President , Commissioner Patten has our understanding .	0.0016037920359700997
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and , therefore , I hope to see him there soon .	0.018884979489522044
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region , accompanied by other Council representatives .	0.8488622354925195
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation .	5.922779514763508
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .	9.143924975231034
In this sense , I share Commissioner Patten ' s positive attitude .	0.0568524496832418
Let me explain : it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities .	0.237569587581334
It is also true , however , that , since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements , 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority , together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and , more importantly , this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with , since , under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh , the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover .	0.0
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks , as Prime Minister Barak has promised .	0.2157864130537437
On the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talks , initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic , is undoubtedly significant , but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed .	0.009867923008603655
Mr President , the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which is the result of a broad consensus , seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes .	0.006188769922687386
I would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences , which are still no doubt profound , between the parties .	0.0005987103077973357
In my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .	0.04680201568580946
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist .	7.402101888106403
But this also serves to make a claim , on the part of the European Union , for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public .	0.17870858800048653
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this .	7.3844041952607045
Mr President , I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account .	0.014689277065620947
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo ' s speech set here .	9.251255381369443
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process .	13.202837204492516
It is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .	8.806423391883213e-05
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago , the difference between then and now is like that between night and day , despite difficulties and delays .	0.051349864525990115
I want to emphasise four points .	53.66159718051192
First of all , the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains , as everyone knows , a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel ' s commitments .	0.0017988225152592548
This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements .	11.433916126172798
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun , I think it is important to keep the two processes apart .	0.264188020677169
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements .	11.287310994822388
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza , the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank , further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments .	0.20900479821087414
The second point relates to Syria .	37.56925198841669
There , the border question is obviously central .	0.01384458730320181
How negotiations are proceeding there , we still do not know .	0.024890837394473637
What is important , however , is that they have begun .	0.00013602483839068752
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water .	9.756454182521512
As things are at present , the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply .	0.16605874234937834
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon .	8.425416816457053
According to UNIFIL , there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw , which is something we welcome .	0.007877517925596418
There too , of course , outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees .	0.0027772101626685913
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State .	22.85536525355925
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without Israel ' s support .	0.09604719699286624
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .	6.415050359118181
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year , there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date .	0.3539343401540304
In this context , it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said , namely a state subject to public control , and that it should be a democratic state .	0.02864291030257884
This is something to which we all want to contribute .	21.170100379956484
Mr President , I would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate .	0.0009605217383337187
My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and , needless to say , approves of it .	0.004440348980857632
More specifically , however , I would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion .	0.000860132850436749
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East .	5.7457012822609945
It is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .	0.0007896134852544092
Indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .	0.04986265921968446
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders , as well as Syria ' s integrity .	0.648998592158577
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue .	11.794955771507647
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria , I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that , in the framework of economic and regional cooperation , a multilateral approach will appear possible .	0.020498858420603908
Nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .	0.005117406032785839
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union ' s common foreign and security policy .	6.48621409216407
This is where Mr Solana , the High Representative to the Council , could come into his own .	0.002843659422810222
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region .	5.612092680118172
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .	7.39815573385739
In this respect , we support Libya ' s participation , provided that it recognises human rights , renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process .	0.0024849402942437667
There are still , needless to say , many unresolved problems and unanswered questions , also involving the Palestinians .	0.0002816729084250231
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that , with the necessary trust , perseverance and indispensable political will , our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East , will be achieved .	0.0011479569140543835
Mr President , it is pleasing that , despite certain delays and problems , the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria .	0.0023378959521469203
The moment of truth is approaching .	34.66190703451339
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN ' s resolutions and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967 ?	0.018026641509975638
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?	1.554405484701244
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan ?	1.6817889636846806
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?	0.0010582648094842253
Will Syria fully accept Israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?	1.738083471522481
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country , Israel , does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .	0.06808237810092325
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all , however .	0.01888273051464593
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state .	13.089747973049944
Against this background , I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler ' s extermination of the Jews is being held , which is obviously a welcome initiative .	0.07010843898103288
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world , not one of them , however , is an Arab state included in the EU ' s Barcelona process .	0.003379085677825311
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis ' anti-Semitism , which of course is completely incorrect .	0.4430999657313835
The Arab world ' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as , for example , Algeria ' s fight for freedom against France .	0.02912291662208879
But today , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel .	0.0001802737974742066
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm .	5.514898464660151
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion .	0.4711629363208225
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East .	8.706158500950258
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 .	6.295890613475724
It is time there were secure borders and political , social and economic rights in every country in this region , and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria , Palestine , Israel and everywhere else .	0.0022011436006170696
This is an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights , and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given .	0.07508898876513775
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982 .	0.4427887416613244
Israel has to accept its responsibilities , withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but , at the same time , it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area .	0.0582989362747048
However , Israel is not the only country concerned with security .	0.056290372921207824
The same goes for the other countries , especially for the Palestinians , who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C , despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements .	0.01821630267273607
Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999 , 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated , 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak ' s Government .	0.12284738752784967
Trees have been uprooted , houses are still being demolished and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in East Jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .	0.00034190627379003465
Nevertheless , there is no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive steps have been taken : negotiations , at least , have resumed .	2.0225374561356578e-05
But in the Middle East , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .	0.05790597343579859
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332 , 248 , 245 and 194 .	0.005518373978480704
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria , as well as Mr Barak ' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements .	0.6562927689835458
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .	9.501113781650382
We cannot be content with a role backstage .	23.437061699668163
We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States , as Minister Gama said .	0.15107861517168525
Mr President , firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process , and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker " for the entire operation .	0.02984563535255954
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended .	6.70897190217919
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .	7.431092076620774
Nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late .	0.24097003233725003
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome .	4.608047536444408
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East .	4.883904111088113
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum .	0.45337434822448414
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .	7.014544737135926
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising .	5.061417842974058
On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement .	0.6006920706808001
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment , as well as the transfer of territories .	0.2628071425486086
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted , as well as not approving new ones , pose further obstacles .	0.11358685220505435
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely .	0.00166077611271384
At present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security .	0.14182927115099417
Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .	0.18118887373911127
In conclusion , while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process , Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward .	0.022541305297322976
I sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved .	0.01465354076589052
Mr President , the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East .	0.07335942661313224
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue .	0.6807552228593144
Indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .	0.06601616039101882
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories , at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine , whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat .	0.24786057855291146
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question , which no one discusses anymore , thereby relegating the problems of millions of women , elderly people and children , the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked , to oblivion .	0.0024613727157561903
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality , but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples ' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold , colourless , artificial neon bulbs in our lamps , which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium .	0.07998943500665977
Mr President , the Israeli author , Amos Oz , managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently .	0.0016244547695507911
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that , in exchange for the Golan Heights , all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt .	0.03475090367919043
Oz ' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press .	12.205016524707444
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of Damascus , President Assad , at the negotiations in the United States .	0.0012470620651000202
Surely Assad would be Barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister .	7.798361177528024
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown .	6.506857947579066
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting .	13.394040371389256
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?	2.002412764098144
Well , the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .	0.10037121736859686
At the end of the day , Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan .	0.22299630126388095
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process .	6.036083796227306
It is , however , very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron , the United States , not to mention the heavy , equally costly , security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan .	0.0007289210270026315
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question .	11.693026700700711
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan ?	2.6051150671635916
Mr President , the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news , but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people .	0.10604455820091731
It is clear that , for once , the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations , and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome : the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967 , while the Israelis wish , since they consider that it suits their situation better , to have the borders which were set in 1923 .	0.005938004774973353
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East .	5.301893367380876
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment .	7.132791181945666
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority , the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February , the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .	0.3111627726930603
What can the European Union do in these circumstances ?	2.967361182433416
Unfortunately , very little .	8.830739472117908e-05
It naturally has to support these negotiations , sponsored by the United States ; contacts have to be increased ; the presence of the European Union envoy , Ambassador Moratinos , who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency , within the powers of the European Union , is positive .	0.00023194049690126404
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence , because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend , we will have to remember that , for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region , 60 are contributed by the European Union .	0.022733613597651834
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow , it becomes clear that the European Union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful .	0.6086318256354256
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process .	0.6939316997021323
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region , as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations , will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process .	0.2334366072642895
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , I should like to thank you for your statements , especially Commissioner Patten , whose analysis I fully share and I shall not , therefore , repeat any of his ideas .	2.9923791838797695e-05
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reasons , a Member can formulate more openly .	0.03302105218651692
First , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities .	0.13775688468134797
But we have enough agreements now : Oslo , Wye Plantation , Sharm el-Sheikh .	1.9885620537951156e-05
We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .	0.031164328939108896
However , in this regard I share Mr Salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week , namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe .	0.09678202228992029
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel .	10.177988609708196
I consider this to be very encouraging news .	28.94143228991038
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued .	7.78941105411258
I should like to make it quite clear : if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria , the problem in this region will be solved .	0.022988106924693014
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations .	0.7567403533371837
In Germany , there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay .	0.44166566721964207
That would be a similar situation .	54.96430503549111
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union .	6.528661535832938
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos ' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there , Commissioner Patten .	0.34872185471705736
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .	0.04932097734267073
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own ; the Presidency of the Council must take action , the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves .	0.35713554669807995
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .	9.499502772161524
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East .	0.01101885768271007
It has taken fifty years to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations .	0.11265077364609045
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope , as Mr Patten said just now , that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East .	0.21746820443830042
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution .	7.947200848954967
We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders .	6.190617483415575
All the foreign troops , including therefore the Syrian forces , must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council .	0.027905098951826496
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000 , the date promised by Ehud Barak ?	0.0537596478630767
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north ?	2.256481393102616
We really hope and believe so .	34.66192172602852
Never have the parties been so determined .	25.246760840957744
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people .	6.281588027564106
There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations .	9.567743185629542
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .	0.13404415410684226
In terms of balance , or should I say imbalance , I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict .	0.07656396061275984
At midday , Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region .	0.05209504639540315
Despite everything , we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington .	0.1510960579808471
Like other Arab countries before them , the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations .	0.09946153012464043
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image , and this is a fact , not a judgement .	0.018962229390793856
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten , Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .	0.6417255622623794
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .	0.37371449665462664
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99 ) and the Commission (B5-0041/99) , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU) .	0.01244374103830575
Mr President , 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council .	0.0182389286846457
These have been the most important moments in the Council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .	0.38052846378673155
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens ' rights - and we rejoice in this ; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty , combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia , and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence , as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union .	0.050191180918482216
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation .	7.137775963361426
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework .	7.380975049013468
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner , Mr Antonio Vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .	0.020160536647392903
Furthermore , they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard " to verify the progress made in this area at Community level , but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States .	0.14336396343204616
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions , despite the fact that , for this House , the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment : that of delaying , for five years , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice .	0.0
However , if , on verifying the progress made during 1999 , which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty , we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out , the scene looks considerably darker , Mr President .	0.0009791907401663963
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other begrudges .	0.2786446536791046
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level , the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged .	0.27917243659448804
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this Parliament is unable to do so .	0.015826530417295277
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them .	6.941666016578943
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament .	7.726896983825548
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out .	9.610678585938363
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework .	0.005433966703196725
Schengen has been incorporated , as we said earlier , into the acquis , but it has been done with very little transparency .	0.0009710017788026186
Not a single piece of information , nor a single consultation , has been addressed to Parliament during this process ; neither on the association of the United Kingdom , nor on the incorporation of Greece , nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland .	0.0016064730292196122
The same is true with regard to immigration policy .	22.840833473881016
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .	0.021930553168482674
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations .	0.23889040171675693
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament .	7.427284636475541
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union .	6.871715663345798
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament ' s decisions , or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project .	0.49621070383706406
If it chooses the second approach , it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice is built .	0.07564517908580533
Alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions , in order to move forward in another way .	0.0128766546777705
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .	0.09933049026555585
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States , and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer , more just and more secure .	0.4661321259568407
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament , you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes .	0.0045716246687073124
As Mrs Terrn i Cus said in her speech , 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council , and a fundamental expectation , as from this year , that will be realised in the form of specific actions .	0.01637761342646436
We are all aware that , to this end , it is essential for the Council to approve , as quickly as possible , the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing .	0.0008828061624505349
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency ' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March .	5.859770570057112
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrn i Cus has put to us , I shall group them into three basic areas : the fight against organised crime , the operation of the Judicial Network , particularly as regards criminal matters , and questions on Europol .	0.0018141678622270374
Regarding the fight against organised crime , 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan , which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations , in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering .	0.09120009962104426
And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency ' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group .	9.937644551610774
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work , not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium , but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists , particularly at Council level , on issues concerning the fight against organised crime .	0.041120007357147735
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency , with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council .	0.4209645870031147
If this is not to be a mere media event , it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee , the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed .	0.09619243328878835
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .	7.91399903952229
Here , in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact , it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation , a plan which is now being finalised , and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States , in Moscow , and to develop a set of further initiatives .	0.01209470968289988
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols , and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe , in particular on cyber crime .	0.08914332758960752
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme , the presidency believes that it is worthwhile , bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty , to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention .	0.1267301740145882
With regard to the Judicial Network , significant progress has been made , in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network , whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan .	0.05385132351028082
However , we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium , so as to give a fresh impetus , while preserving continuity , to the work done under the previous action plan .	0.011763500345023797
Still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro , and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance .	0.061158757176637414
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible , we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments , and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects , including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for .	0.10359964469276264
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions , and we believe that on the basis of work already done , it will be possible , at least in the field of seizure of assets , for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions .	0.03245339827809097
Lastly then , Europol , which started its work in 1999 .	3.7232527036488336e-05
The Council approved a set of instruments , with which Parliament is familiar , to make Europol ' s operations viable but , of course , the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain , and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol ' s powers and , above all , to give it an operational dimension .	0.00338116112947224
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol .	4.065710879881077
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network , since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust , this option cannot be ruled out at present .	0.17112410335850964
For this reason , it is essential that the Council ' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel , so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also .	0.07377601028985431
I believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust , it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol .	0.30286192281210944
We are familiar with Parliament ' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council ' s legal advisers .	10.360325996657274
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol , and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved .	0.915667406125761
Mr President , Members of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions , I have to say that I am not moved , rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time , and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union ! I would also like to thank Mrs Terrn i Cus for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , and to thank all the Members who , in their various committees , have actively participated in preparing this annual debate .	0.0
I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society .	10.11853612766521
In this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999 .	0.34614403651313297
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom , security and justice .	0.534806383725923
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .	0.7287860797432435
At the same time , it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms , and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy .	0.011723827920164295
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union .	8.966244662743469
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union , recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base , with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access , on equal terms , and in which our citizens can have real confidence .	0.04229321556955226
The Union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at Tampere .	0.17364237706042807
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council , reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project , together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality , following a progressive strategy , within a time-frame of five years , and that , above all , the three components of this area should be in balance : freedom , security and justice .	0.0010806254577324045
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency ' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .	6.2657366686489855
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union ' s development , it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter , so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens .	0.20759796221945304
As I have already said on a number of occasions , I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect , on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process , the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law , rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator .	0.05752007935352252
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission , I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe ' s common heritage .	0.8623134788857925
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen , an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms , with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection , in other words , a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies .	0.05784702094123817
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament , that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and , as a consequence , the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities .	0.08381362391941652
In addition to these events , I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .	0.17417440625088673
In the field of immigration , borders and asylum , the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database , and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families , as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union .	0.04287791732063388
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries .	4.239005492298886
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and ultimately , in December , it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund .	0.006575278012890092
In the field of judicial cooperation , the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation " of certain conventions .	0.1753353484894383
These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I) , the convention on jurisdiction , recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II) , and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters .	0.05545756340931033
In 1999 , we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union , which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere .	0.01111364180364181
This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime , in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation , including the cost of justice .	0.047457969907598596
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment .	8.457750294920075
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime , the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering .	0.28646721087065014
In 1999 , Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission , echoing the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions , and in particular Eurojust .	0.02882872570111214
In 1999 , the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs , which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council .	0.011819463906165258
This list of actions , which is not exhaustive , should , here today , in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House , help to make it clear that , while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area , it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase , marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice .	0.0012377788432860965
For this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU ' s institutions respond to our citizens ' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement , with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection .	0.16840730639801618
In other words , 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council , for Parliament and for the Commission .	0.13681321514490696
As I have already said , the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam , in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council .	0.45173859612921996
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning .	12.246570662590633
It will also , and above all , be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union ' s institutions towards the public .	0.03123987750502591
It is for the public , therefore , that we are developing the area of freedom , security and justice .	0.00017378269320339576
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council , nor even to the European Parliament , but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves , in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity .	0.10954787279639783
In the coming weeks , I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs .	0.28937051299849414
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .	12.759675449428833
And we hope , during the Portuguese Presidency , to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council , taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned .	0.005206838000407492
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .	0.46340719503601135
For this reason , and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing , I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship , for legality and , ultimately , for democracy itself .	0.02173344309411653
In addition to the scoreboard , I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom , security and justice as a priority in its work programme .	0.32937314144532226
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which is also the political message of Tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies .	0.1579786702874699
Regarding immigration and asylum , the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees ; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis , in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam ; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union ; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers .	0.09194763823209647
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses .	0.9257889165401446
Furthermore , on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States , which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons , I shall , in the next few days , be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders .	0.005191136121555345
Turning to judicial cooperation , in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations , I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings .	0.19636476107249232
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims , alimony claims and non-contested claims .	0.7088548502229403
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions , the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime .	0.3801980736978787
We will be organising and supporting actions including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters .	0.027866303555560377
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention , so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area , and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose .	0.07138614517025015
The Commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue .	0.7041574468002075
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions , criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings , economic exploitation of immigrants , and sexual exploitation of woman and children , with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication , notably the Internet , for distributing child pornography .	0.006074218728249811
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime .	6.6804287114229775
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004 .	12.054280162822876
In this field the Commission , in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament , will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February .	0.04491772814937712
With regard to Schengen , without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council , or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework , I would like to stress , on the topical subject of restoring border controls , that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2 ) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority .	0.021764824006530056
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty .	4.825571373304263
As was emphasised at Tampere , and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000 , we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies , which strengthen the links between the Union ' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union ' s position on the world stage .	0.24220483464377393
Nevertheless , I must make it clear that all these actions will , of course , have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries , so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .	0.005128411308976694
Furthermore , it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki .	1.151578334432231
Lastly , I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.38955088952408684
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself .	6.359679006967571
As I have told Parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .	0.040602275864413374
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament , and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives , so that the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible , thus allowing us all to contribute , in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , to the realisation of this project , which is , without a doubt , the "jewel in the crown " of the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.001900190226532727
Mr President , having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market , the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other ' s competence .	0.038302671934627955
Commissioner Vitorino , although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us .	0.04403873368429735
It looked , as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee , as if the Council understood the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein , security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will .	0.008037472452887821
Minister Gomes , I have , of course , heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency .	0.0006304535888322309
I should like to raise three points which for us , as Members of the PPE Group , must be focal points when such an area is created .	0.03499508643312896
First : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed .	0.17881188112655685
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers .	7.111590510741467
As far as a European asylum law is concerned , a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere .	0.218203599716485
Unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .	0.0006178514142827688
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union .	6.6624295738012895
Similarly , it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .	0.40188102526432
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .	8.796744023817848
Secondly : the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime , including by Europol and Eurojust .	0.0025301108877948245
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith .	7.954958578442743
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work .	16.65580039381489
However , the Council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen Europol ' s remit , as decided at Tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities .	0.0060089451872525805
We are not just calling for more control , and more control over Europol ; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more! " With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is inefficient control .	0.032776760221942154
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without hampering the work of Europol .	0.1747382393252731
At the same time , we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction .	0.20098419104448187
Thirdly : the extension to Parliament ' s rights in this context .	0.055939151862570806
If the establishment of such an area , in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens , is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats , while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens .	0.022641808630024258
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .	0.0383012293442746
We want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of Europe , not against them .	0.004313554008597479
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown .	6.926733067586442
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten ' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .	7.23011305506794
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised .	7.087895373667468
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress .	11.330249055718122
The first is asylum .	153.38498264572956
It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .	0.011923738876982856
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years .	15.921787907460486
The second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals .	0.02688860456463403
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .	0.21641533575699626
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .	10.094376372464122
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on .	0.005266273982379103
But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France , including British student , Isabel Peake , who was thrown off a train , shows why we need mutual recognition .	0.004570814511745677
Arrested and released in Madrid , he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon .	0.0817494729582955
Whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .	0.09895126285140275
Finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .	0.0004887855453749152
Mr President , all I can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter .	0.006113792070558382
I hope that it works out .	64.79723893711547
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .	0.013140458702053015
Numerous questions are still outstanding .	47.18707849478637
Answers are still awaited .	89.70024649684188
Since Tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .	0.02936010177974784
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .	10.949225352906424
On the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .	0.1699631284523281
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .	10.147501691245953
However , it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union .	0.646302382786042
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force .	11.495020402610123
In Tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .	0.0054475239675951595
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .	9.903195372657354
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC .	27.89259709968269
Parliament has amended the contractual text .	34.66191480137242
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament ' s modus operandi .	14.660499294745591
Unfortunately , no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them .	0.10896345150116352
Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .	0.23531959201378724
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe .	10.190733649186194
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .	0.4790266194269784
Mr President , Commissioner , the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrn i Cus shows that this House is taking a firm stance .	0.005898801421883638
Indeed , six months after the election of this new Parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe .	0.04588497565770122
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this .	16.71754751052412
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .	0.014636940221808968
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems .	5.4287288881288145
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres .	11.099880275301265
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .	0.3905826325298058
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme-right racist movements .	0.03888589387537808
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .	14.321846560291009
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable .	8.125460611250578
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect .	8.306535566823763
Last week , and somewhat by chance , I witnessed , at Roissy airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young women , admittedly illegal immigrants , were being returned to Conakry .	3.360782910134504e-05
They were treated like the worst criminals .	25.24675835738458
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair , surrounded by a horde of state security police .	0.241113817063157
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour .	14.015724382704468
Our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships .	0.11873003212709403
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed .	9.827798625763505
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .	0.27487797178241885
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .	0.2863826307443886
Likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action .	0.28517734386471505

The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries , including your own , must act as an example to others .	0.009235879332725839
These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords , an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation , rendering them modern-day slaves .	0.04967607525483902
In more general terms , this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants .	0.25743048713590594
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .	8.477147508006182
How do you intend to make our people understand that , today like always , immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is , and will remain , essential in the context of population ?	0.0015767128184762313
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers ?	2.6624898936466894
Mr President , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .	0.001917183064931463
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees .	8.044224100355823
The level of racism in our society is terrifying .	20.70647302225491
Ireland , for generations , sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world , but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations , we are showing a very ugly side to our character .	0.004052780211939115
Racism in Ireland is endemic .	52.09874020441271
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time .	5.939389140916564
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .	8.78761612494465
There is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union .	0.3154046134948114
Mr President , we take note that the excuse-making , reticent Presidency , which , in recent months , has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today , has come to an end .	0.00017766545634580126
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz ' s remarks , and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom , security and justice , without having to derogate from their own powers .	0.05243321775420886
Nevertheless , to avoid the customary circus , which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council , maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years .	0.05358992037258204
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are , of course , underpinned by a mantra of the kind which , in recent years , has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding , but pernicious .	0.00044546690161409447
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ : Area for Freedom , Security and Justice .	0.0019094861200611173
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House , namely to introduce such an area .	0.4914921107359796
And who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?	0.00946181576517719
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions .	8.74109988979433
Freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .	0.0011377676755917928
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .	5.97211955805296
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .	0.1711210452048623
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .	10.223868695355653
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .	13.503497782104219
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU ' s control .	0.4149112331556143
It is concerned with increased integration which , as part of a duplicitous package , involves increased repression and control .	0.009628949285370746
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa , Schengen , Eurodac etc .	0.002948393461098724
Any democrat can spot two key problems .	25.246755246705046
First of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .	0.052103218146884844
How is it envisaged that the EU ' s institutions , which are already stretched well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition ?	0.010796908306128618
Think of last year ' s deadly criticism of the Commission ' s lack of propriety , ethics and accountability .	0.3399520998514803
It also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .	3.8597806587576064e-05
But , secondly , the projects will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracies .	3.5238766243688315e-05
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market , only the body was being attacked .	0.09520999543914074
Now , it is the soul .	0.0023086718410987067
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony .	0.01352738776560957
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .	0.0974760638691626
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the loyalist terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community .	0.11080158072086539
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .	10.46792545127185
In 1998 , we had 55 murders .	0.0007285082156073516
In 1999 , we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .	0.09635845541349179
Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .	0.011655240278620568
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97 .	0.10040061342476979
Since January 2000 , there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults .	0.0040242120630804125
Mr President , that situation cannot continue and needs remedying .	0.003933851198471232
Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union .	0.016289867676857573
This is a task which all MEPs , the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as has been said already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .	0.0002606455999045516
The Tampere Council , the motor and architect of this objective , has proposed certain goals , but five years , the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty , is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require .	0.0025817904863979567
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed , especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens , as the Commissioner has explained very well .	0.21754581162608874
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopting common procedural rules and , above all , putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons .	0.03275504816808408
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country , Spain , and in Belgium , are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .	0.0047059407704805305
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum .	9.060561146532747
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants .	6.920310246950162
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area , but we must do so with rigour , with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions , which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs .	0.16648177759353563
Finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .	0.009866957272245697
The Euro , employment , even security , are not enough .	1.5725634379510323e-07
They need a 'European soul ' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said .	0.07501449396844018
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino .	0.011837245935962313
This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said .	7.128403391656884
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated .	13.379876549192225
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .	7.923801610875275
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .	6.935616814389082
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months .	4.81776476663098
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .	0.1807597321865143
One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .	0.0023084360536128985
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised , that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it .	1.4814755048081092
And we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .	0.17470830168608478
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .	0.49346022363327463
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .	10.752194406554722
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about .	14.93230937374006
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system , for example .	0.2795042743342869
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .	0.7615317549473729
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard ' .	8.19413673452404
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is .	8.326090066377638
A scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible .	0.20765788032255636
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so .	11.183550493714373
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening .	12.632142059756443
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed .	0.009642114973068902
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrn today shows .	0.19239666799233804
I would like to make three brief points .	33.21178266804661
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament .	8.40504485881365
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been sizing each other up , we have had a few minor spats , but we need to work effectively together .	0.0199164193606015
Let us stop the shadow-boxing .	52.09874818481572
Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .	4.905611044577587
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .	11.571302655709777
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .	5.615913792992236
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission .	20.22778127075597
We have established a new Directorate-General , yet it has only 70 people all told .	0.10389589338580864
There is an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .	0.0006022701129780664
We are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .	0.1692156537052911
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs .	12.511259769013726
Finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .	0.00571580603418032
All good things come in threes , especially in our policy area .	0.04594369350745719
Two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fraternity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others .	0.03468257401977085
Now it is freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice .	0.007310382592791205
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mentioned , we must remember that there is still room for progress .	0.0422186386761173
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete .	11.183203612508605
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this .	5.720999885508329
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic , including all people , whatever their nationality , or excluding some .	0.03417884848372814
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted .	6.805725393957771
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .	0.08459218234211763
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements .	14.10182045931429
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement ' [no turning back] .	10.657813630128516
Furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament .	0.2904789186894103
However , the main concern remains .. .	3.1047248358431764e-05
(The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner .	0.3951285873992332
I thank them for their statements to the House .	12.777072806572532
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies .	0.7266744894316732
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States .	4.713758422747584
We already have , on the international side , plans in place to combat drug trafficking , money laundering and so on .	0.0006230071852708699
But to bring it down to a more human level : to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs , and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation ; secondly , to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws ; thirdly , to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people ; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation " and "harm reduction " and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people .	0.0331542326440852
Mr President , I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out , or remind , the representative of the Commission that , in Belgium , the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence , right to be reunited with their families , etc .	0.0018305761364224636
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty .	10.41685384593014
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December .	8.507036172545341
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me , within the foreseeable future , of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State , in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty .	0.03377795364527261
Mr President , esteemed gentlemen from Portugal , especially the Council representatives , you face great expectations on our part .	0.0001503967182887182
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .	7.902823102628862
I refer to Eurodac .	129.3701080135258
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications , in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and , above all , in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure .	0.06678481713728396
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .	0.08397786144157914
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality .	11.760164679849254
Even in Tampere , we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality .	0.068255588973049
However , the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected , i.e . that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation , that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that , where possible , Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure .	0.003091500353976857
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .	9.742289166144813
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures .	5.784952108906931
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .	0.16731658772506583
Mr President , Ministers , Commissioner , the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich , so much so that it became difficult to gather , i.e . to put those decisions into practice .	1.3503887595406522e-05
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made .	9.257347347312352
However , the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions , such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam , the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar , and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions , priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom , security and justice .	0.017432458035209326
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the European Parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament .	0.002034505407476847
From what I have said , it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer .	0.39057113550779193
Neither will it stop raising vital issues .	25.246757789103384
For example , how much progress are you willing to make and what measures , legislative or otherwise , will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings , child pornography on the Internet , drugs , and organised crime ?	0.00011639110829032966
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?	2.5382546435642377
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community , reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe ?	0.29481011991761624
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN , is it not about time you abandoned your traditional , conservative views on refugees and immigrants ?	0.02048763401348135
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency .	10.654808358908001
Mr President , I welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .	3.024205762767459e-05
But I want to add a word of caution .	25.9972543956954
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community , but too many : national , European Union and European Convention ; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there , there is the Court in Luxembourg .	0.004414230960476357
There are also courts in Karlsruhe , London , Lisbon , Dublin and Edinburgh .	2.6042507133806116e-05
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .	18.767834513886722
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .	0.01830769070583298
We need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .	0.002760534055860091
But we must look always to subsidiarity .	35.21792073186728
Like everybody in this House , I want freedom , justice and security .	0.0004155260931235762
I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation , chaos and confusion .	0.135798077368758
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would very quickly like to make one point .	0.0005083140409854547
Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency .	10.231433873188344
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal , and my colleague , the Minister for Justice , and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week .	0.04650433194179039
(Sustained applause ) Thank you , Minister .	0.0042897443994659315
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
Mr President , I am grateful for the Council ' s oral , and also written , reply .	7.291877226463039e-05
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable .	37.7990847712691
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights and Freedoms , Justice and Home Affairs .	0.6119282103812596
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well .	11.241498515894923
Personally , I am pleased with some of the replies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .	0.007558890835473783
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .	14.090233487968465
Representatives of the Council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament .	0.15981004108177338
I am sure that , with the willingness that you have shown today , the first thing you will do , in this new climate of understanding between us , will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you .	0.006275449612013377
Question Time (Council ) The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000) .	12.545132216699898
We will examine questions to the Council .	9.378920231060718
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99) : Subject : Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the Atatrk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .	0.11715279053853854
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan .	0.7699040998180098
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget ?	1.702357166955337
Mr President , the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety , the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis .	0.026659044835718463
The aim of this convention , which came into force on 24 October 1996 , is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation .	0.10866551947748639
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks , so as to protect individuals , society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations .	0.17768713756529322
The convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .	0.024547083218542456
I would also like to remind Members that , as a candidate for membership of the European Union , Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition , which is an important point - sooner or later , as part of its own pre-accession strategy , have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time , and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety .	0.008426209774140124
Thank you for your answer .	45.63442005635712
However , I would just like to add the following .	0.021685252810989236
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit .	8.111441649959005
Nevertheless , rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons .	0.3369368893095239
In this respect , the issue requires closer examination , because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people ' s suspicions .	0.016945294564046542
My second point concerns the safety of these plants .	24.621867392601594
In areas of high seismic risk , it is not enough just to have secure , earthquake-proof buildings .	0.0033038099301309866
Speaking as an engineer , I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances .	0.3560057133977729
However , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .	0.0069086529095725106
With this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes .	0.2612513554174606
In this respect , and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union , we should be helping it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .	0.0045411215749689956
That is our role and this is the point of my question .	15.921975853522643
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward .	7.790885607499692
This is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .	5.520888986395645e-06
Furthermore , it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey , in view of that country ' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union .	0.06913423452247862
It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations .	10.918008830251807
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country ' s own pre-accession strategy agenda .	0.7129223143973918
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns , and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account .	0.27665878188215837
Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council .	0.0043513395906534125
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog .	6.804076398681905
However , forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .	0.23664679720353687
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately .	12.297878218615853
Will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list .	0.015130084876013397
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?	1.9289814303016077
Mr Newton Dunn , I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question , and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future .	0.12481020740998859
With regard to what you were saying , it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council , apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note , does not actually refer to the opacity , shall we say , of the legislative process , but rather almost to an excess of transparency .	0.00340642472163008
However , I would like to say , Mr Newton Dunn , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable .	0.009012263659140644
We have no problem , Mr Newton Dunn , in repeating this information to you in writing , but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here , because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly .	0.0079863653182867
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council ' s functions as a legislative body .	6.597743241254858
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question .	16.150402793036974
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled .	14.02108594515535
Instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.11591990745215552
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there ?	3.393094958530259
I should like to have an answer to that question .	20.465039836106374
Does the Council consider that , on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the EU ' s institutions ?	0.004129145278951338
Mr Sjstedt , the answer that I gave was the only answer possible .	0.012227597564889626
Nevertheless , I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity .	0.35971630672145916
At the moment , there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article , and unless there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .	0.008652283983729121
In any event , Article 255 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .	0.0033514889682427483
I am , up to a point , concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process .	0.07931803987308733
How is this to be done when , at the same time , the Commission ' s proposal - which has been leaked , so the general public is aware of it - says that employees ' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents , reports , drafts etc ?	0.006954592989339427
Does not the Council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?	3.1403977767806044
Mrs Frahm , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference .	0.08588811429591309
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards " , it also applies between the institutions .	0.3238733234734035
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions ' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions , and not only as regards the Commission ' s relationship with Parliament , but also as regards the Commission ' s relationship with the Council .	0.25323595043744507
As a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions .	0.006041639162561599
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference .	9.295753803458938
The matter is still open .	52.09876011974032
Genuine transparency of the institutions ' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which , in my opinion , needs to be studied again , particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .	0.022385058872961806
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again .	6.850278461909675
I believe that the Commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .	0.9207353052512789
For our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .	0.05950639495810264
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjstedt and others have asked .	10.988135268466735
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .	0.5131620303182642
We are very anxious indeed that the EU , too , should move in this direction , and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.001362192230796792
One or two years ago , Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lw which is extremely important in this context .	0.1925351678897132
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States .	4.870692046424897
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament .	10.191509967926322
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning , in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission .	0.3724662424004206
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference .	6.020002704439828
My concern is , if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC , whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.15112193050221395
After all , examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies .	0.4380700484814149
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference , which would mean widening the agenda .	0.12484527544663185
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .	0.01168279967429715
This Intergovernmental Conference will , at the outset , concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate , particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transparent and more efficient .	0.003636548555777494
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims .	5.387672918214306
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference .	0.020936622131166552
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference .	7.843911266153628
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament , who will surely rally behind this proposal .	0.2621835232531702
We will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .	0.0019060943378142168
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam , which was approved last May , and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress .	0.08626395715914605
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency .	10.340662418392094
My feeling is that , in spite of everything , this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public is clearly concerned about it , and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public .	0.007436974305041655
As far as we are concerned , they will be .	0.00945057871338348
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .	14.309273708906575
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99) : Subject : Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000 , and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical .	0.0783605588665306
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing ) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future ?	0.779125737904671
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks ?	0.2648633896526861
What measures does the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?	0.0037822785227807115
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way , and I shall explain how .	0.0076936517897827055
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers .	7.463740193467219
Nevertheless , at the last Fisheries Council of 1999 , held on 16 and 17 December , the Member States involved in this area of fishing , namely France , Spain and Portugal , considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes , as the Commission proposed , was excessively cautious .	0.00039881088866486103
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks , that is the species of fish being affected , and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits .	0.09946143371719511
This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999 .	4.753105572107907
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .	0.5027350270715253
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX , the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .	0.5592005736860576
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in French waters .	0.36631008199225823
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall , over the whole Community fishing area .	0.3735646577484317
In accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France .	0.3905502139606071
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters , the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France .	0.5091381358781165
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal ' s point of view .	8.5630035319553
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea , which we also understand .	0.34151837275645985
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all .	0.07486528195683664
I understand that Portugal is affected by this .	16.082540212596683
However , it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies , which , until 1995 , were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds , through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France , should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea .	0.01402600493388971
It has been shown , as we have been claiming since 1995 , that this move is appalling , and , if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement , that is fine by us , but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay .	0.0011888716436306923
Today , scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay .	0.13653064538164544
I do not know if you are aware , representatives of the Council of Ministers , of your responsibility over these last few years , and in 2000 as well , for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular .	0.007820980128711715
I would like to say , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , that in its judgement of 5 October 1999 , the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer , which was approved , was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and , specifically , with its Article 9(1) , which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated .	0.0013357676913736266
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France ' s at 10% .	4.6703747380798895
Apart from this , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way , on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain .	0.10649160587102355
Accordingly , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of France ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay .	0.009147337918204025
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .	5.16042255380793
In concrete terms , 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999 .	0.002252783574235203
These numbers represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council , a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95 .	0.08672706816485713
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99) : Subject : Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999 , NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities .	0.037071680406136016
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies , Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244 .	0.5763133126040595
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings , abductions , detentions , intimidation , arson , looting , destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc .	8.57059065995115e-05
In the light of the above , will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo , as requested by Parliament ?	0.003862308576421625
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?	1.9139225414402667
Mr Alavanos , I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised .	0.09820580796375503
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities , for both the Serb and Romany populations , and the incidents of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region .	0.021054581987259242
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts .	6.718895654890812
The Council once again reiterated the need , in its December conclusions , to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and , in particular , to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region ' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented .	0.024249164389485874
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians , we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population , the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable .	0.11928336167872071
It will not be tolerated , and must stop immediately .	0.03171946010114615
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated .	5.6585408776095765
I think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlies the European Union ' s position , is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained .	0.016349525511828455
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .	4.996316668674005
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin .	5.012026916733197
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction , in its December conclusions , at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission , which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal , together with similar contributions made by Member States .	0.003076777590833662
Nevertheless , Mr Alavanos , the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount , in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise , and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground .	0.023462810711664138
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region ' s multi-ethnic nature .	4.623779743299444
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council .	9.088121808284894
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal , its former president , Mr Soares , and its government , maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans .	0.0015625118728250919
Today ' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which I welcome .	0.15902709179125063
However , there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union .	0.19339976872400866
Unfortunately , we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb , Romany , Turkish , and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next .	0.0006260908013385997
The United Nation ' s , and Mr Kouchner ' s , mission in Kosovo ended in failure .	0.002163436477533722
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .	0.4614246533966908
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner , who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today .	0.698082388740432
Mr Alavanos , I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner ' s responsibilities , and I would like to make two very important points here .	0.03013096073090538
The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations .	6.049147108906114
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways .	6.979601346549054
There is one thing , however , that we cannot deny , and that is that Mr Kouchner ' s efforts to return Kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive .	0.006469247602615735
This is undeniable , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts , for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner ' s control , have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be .	0.03131761706467608
I have one last point to make , which is about the European Union ' s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo .	0.0007042134831052886
Therefore , the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context .	0.1680621397761962
It is the international community , and specifically the United Nations , which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and , in particular , for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality .	0.0022557922204637275
These are questions which we should all be asking , but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations .	0.1581493838059599
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .	0.005307720195130369
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .	9.61741835282938
The question which I therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area , how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ?	0.07793418603577064
We have endeavoured to provide material help .	28.524558790592305
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action .	13.348550300005723
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?	2.4135271804667515
Mr Rbig , as I said , I understand your concerns very well .	0.0001130431758825106
I think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few months , there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently .	0.0066993754679733316
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue , and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed .	0.8112224613770099
In other words , he has been given these resources .	0.02232804723678634
There are two fundamental questions in particular .	20.737677297837017
Firstly , an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and , in particular , in protecting certain sections of the civilian population .	0.005423905589412303
Secondly , an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on .	0.368110527013975
The issue which we should all raise , and I did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99 .	0.0007538237326884333
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .	0.3777080079639699
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety .	20.757554660262066
Nevertheless , we must look at this resolution , and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later .	0.03210330733751266
We will have to do so because , as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world , we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process , and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future .	0.14273965517301976
What we have to do , and we in the European Union are already doing it , is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources , and you are right , Mr Rbig , we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used .	0.005183858375490887
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency .	10.015014767055034
Mr Seixas da Costa , I totally agree with you .	0.01619248405202104
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working , namely Resolution 1244 .	0.26569022182312535
Having said this , the EU ' s responsibility , which is both yours and ours , is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region .	0.010795977527231769
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses , accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos .	0.2759994837991295
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo ?	2.8427608265680755
If so , does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region , avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States , as has tended to happen elsewhere , and reuniting the parties , in this case Kosovo and Albania ?	0.0006212798182237605
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99) : Subject : New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled : Promotion of urban , rural and coastal development , the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy .	0.003610917258119612
However , housing is specifically excluded .	0.0050619602728941265
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest , including small cottages , and , given the need , for a variety of reasons , to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas , does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG ?	0.0031343157371468964
Mr President , the Council and , I think , the Portuguese Presidency in particular , are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher ' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas .	0.007364062028153133
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development .	5.059731597811128
This was , as you know , one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level .	0.02106486949127357
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund , the EAGGF , this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas , an issue you are quite right to raise .	0.007982786224990648
On the other hand , the European Regional Development Fund , the ERDF , also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion , by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion .	0.00560557481034674
In this regard , we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas .	0.26956517767886734
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today , furthermore , is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also , have developed and changed .	0.03518410872576519
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy , and the EAGGF , of course , has a crucial role to play in this .	0.01596875715949654
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99) : Subject : Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares ?	0.22108709923234873
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House ' s discussions , because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length .	0.8148516561230106
During the Portuguese Presidency , we will be continuing discussions on the CAP , by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union ' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers ' incomes , paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms .	0.10628624382591031
On the other hand , the Portuguese Presidency will continue , if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office , which is by no means guaranteed , to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened .	0.00509893396366859
It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred .	6.231822539241869
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning .	6.01663752397198
We think that the role of food safety , specifically in terms of everything linked to public health , is one of our presidency ' s essential tasks .	0.03763275373660109
It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme .	22.568822976170413
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes , in the Agriculture Council , the Health Council , the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council .	0.0032012644597969875
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June , the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago .	0.7467618650584164
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market , to stabilise confidence in this market , to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety .	0.5469695206715681
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House .	0.07180538038680628
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .	27.739048855898673
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming , mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs .	1.063542130956118
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , European standards of food safety do not apply .	0.022797319323873213
I completely understand your concerns , and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue .	0.3829821173949067
We also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .	0.16693725760151384
Nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further .	0.03023254390143797
The Council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .	18.578653269409003
Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber .	0.0180695658871172
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field .	5.234919827706857
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency .	5.485176747681972
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level .	6.2364226625867305
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States .	0.4434885168228627
Mr Crowley , with regard to the presidency ' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless , I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome , and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them .	0.012247381332505216
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency , which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme .	0.4386698030102692
We have no specific , concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency .	1.0010401251612846
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council ' s scope for action .	9.521607771218175
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission ' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself .	6.90362306867094
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have talked a lot about the future , about what the Commission will do , and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon , etc .	0.000515528758357485
However , you also said something which I find particularly frightening .	0.04377037672626483
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .	12.33711523693635
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .	0.0031340398581280937
I do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .	0.004361071158574627
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following : what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on , for example , the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policies , particularly for speculative capital , and the policy of redistributing wealth ?	0.0006655032883644829
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters .	11.591103459984549
You must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited .	5.477656474481339
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission ' s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .	0.6530685547751022
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal ' s initiative in convening it , and I have spoken about the future , because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion .	0.09335161108706243
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion .	8.126277168198893
The second is to create internationally competitive conditions , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union , and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion .	0.06329241941452454
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can , in six months , resolve problems that have always existed .	0.01725535418542304
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence .	11.295972127674803
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented , specifically by non-governmental organisations , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters .	0.09330359212388117
We should , however , also bear in mind , Mr Papayannakis , that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact , armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months .	0.0006506753788067893
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the homeless may be dead , will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union .	0.042386192260106
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .	9.197621598171725
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99) : Subject : Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy , the Convention of Lom and tackling famine situations ?	0.015077297529527545
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position .	0.4605711213116456
But there are some questions still outstanding .	29.714120567933534
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme .	9.077387461802973
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict .	5.879603541917549
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .	11.036485854039716
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa .	8.739814230628497
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands .	0.03115572432375103
At the same time , there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns , after which we will send the bread .	0.0639966507694455
First of all , Mr Andrews , you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development .	0.04308980667030264
There is no contradiction between our two positions , quite the opposite .	0.04804801879186436
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs , we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face , particularly in the area of external relations .	0.12471033390423081
As you can understand , it would be easy to do so .	0.03295298333114465
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .	0.3058472101843889
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments ' ability to act and within the scope of the Council .	4.395845206413911
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes .	0.2653017538996253
You have mentioned Ethiopia , which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes , but there are , as you know , several Community actions to combat AIDS , and in this respect , you are right , and the United States will probably not do any better .	0.0001399718761591186
Indeed , in terms of development aid policy , I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States .	0.09135025684605731
Your question switched to the subject of arms , a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will , of course , address in the future , if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context .	0.012540197009402326
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?	3.485348786938002
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?	2.277487853284341
Since the author is not present , Question No 13 lapses .	0.046970453229791514
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency .	0.14776116588139926
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs .	8.978148791048106
Unfortunately , in my case , he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer .	0.0036060711940286098
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .	0.0009750235571055375
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is , I am afraid , just an excuse .	0.060384329576987944
My question , which has not been answered , is why , when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union , the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether .	0.0028803795550654304
This is a true example of the Council ' s indifference towards culture , despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance .	0.7910770313595794
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas , hops , cows and Indian hemp .	0.06254513295137913
Mr Marinos , we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension is , I am sure you will appreciate , one of our main concerns .	0.00010635753810053358
These cultural dimensions , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives .	0.008694790762138737
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union , and especially within the framework of the Council .	0.2496502221168514
For our part , we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere , because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union ' s image and to the Union ' s own particular identity .	0.301166120655949
This is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation .	0.0005433749810951899
As you know , both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately .	0.08292295475357161
In specific terms , we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations , at which this will be a central issue .	0.12185720669354416
Nevertheless , I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe ' s main fears .	0.06659839047221026
We also intend to initiate a new debate , a more innovative one , on the issue of Europe ' s film heritage , given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy .	0.05266338337346608
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe , which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency , in conjunction with the Commission , in February 2000 .	0.0176665802908009
But , Mr Marinos , in the EU context , culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas .	0.0008088900965871128
If , by chance , it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , then this could be suggested , both by Member States , and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group .	0.004258500154589096
Of course , if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , there might eventually be progress .	0.0036342780443683917
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .	10.734588661895852
We will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .	0.004950925480147946
Mr President , I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .	0.030187556668612857
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it , you would consider it .	0.42634794912490115
Well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it .	0.00641893865723313
I appreciate that it is a provocative question .	37.27257053094171
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves .	6.289727772030655
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens .	5.448173488556909
I cannot think of a better way to do it .	11.816146274329034
Can you ?	1.0
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties .	6.858802342859504
This is an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place .	0.06932178484074085
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree .	8.931942588893365
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .	0.005866660027854878
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included , particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included , other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference ' s agenda .	0.2776785044712396
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion .	15.493248177425462
I would ask him to be brief .	32.81050902471217
Mr President , I understand that I have to do this very quickly .	0.02334990656872509
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas .	12.082610808687232
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings .	11.563377580628686
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports .	7.139357863910377
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings .	7.222615451575713
As I suspected , it was not exactly a procedural motion , but more a closing of the debate .	0.004061732958666197
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .	0.11189114663878656
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one .	8.691328025010272
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .	4.644360070749852
It is not the Portuguese Presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the European Parliament is asking for .	0.4832335214742179
After this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing .	0.04652265632345103
That concludes questions to the Council .	13.29288243266666
Capital tax The next item is the joint debate on : the oral question (B5-0004/2000 ) by Mr Dsir and others , to the Council , on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax the oral question (B5-0005/2000 ) by Mr Dsir and others , to the Commission , on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax .	0.005402203578263077
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , during the Asian crisis in 1997 , as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993 , everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation , particularly currency speculation .	0.0005446125471792672
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets .	5.678727895780644
In three or four days , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global GDP , of approximately EUR 6 000 billion .	0.0026557920824175274
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .	6.456783461662003
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can , in a few hours , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , plunging its whole population into recession .	0.011106779218764297
In view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin , winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics , to create a tax on currency transactions .	0.011034599450149276
The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments , but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation , thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions .	0.1489801895800391
Note that this proposed tax , which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people , would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation .	0.06067621923470004
Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere .	8.289204756119547
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC , SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal , is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries , in areas such as education or health .	0.013823117408393946
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .	8.346601459836178
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President , Fernando Cardoso , the Finnish Government , the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995 .	0.013274790294125559
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU .	6.949662588300346
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union .	5.203571949394926
This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members .	10.785198678258745
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL , Greens/EFA , ELDR and PSE Groups .	0.027492534052972018
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax .	6.904199838221265
It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens .	4.768798834522124
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be said of any tax .	0.3987873486410279
If this argument had been accepted in the past , then no taxes would ever have been created .	0.09654265994999361
The motion also asks that a position document , drawn up by the Commission and Council , should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF .	0.0339718552440119
The European Union must take the initiative and must also , as demanded in the motion , propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question .	0.049374311739335465
If the Union takes the initiative , this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world , including in the USA and Japan .	0.02885711272110217
A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people , their parliaments , their governments and their democratic institutions .	0.03503511310646801
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of European construction .	0.08177689131913782
Madam President , I do not have a great deal to add on this subject .	0.02178692377039585
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested .	9.059087846128223
This is a creative initiative , which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics , but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue .	0.10216825762208494
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .	0.4146867256156791
Madam President , the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions .	0.1186631761895586
Such transactions , according to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables .	0.0006999440654381593
This has also just been underlined by Mr Dsir .	15.921786348932486
Therefore , according to proponents , such as Mr Dsir , an internationally applied Tobin tax would , in principle , reduce speculative transactions and , hence , the volatility of exchange rates , which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity .	1.6210533938521586e-05
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams , even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue .	0.2893073991364751
In reality , the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic .	0.12555750508597258
Indeed , it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by .	0.09912029370278531
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the Tobin tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .	0.0023629503142005206
Mr Dsir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .	9.771896815133987
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .	0.7392921486514358
Put more strongly , in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds , the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens .	0.0523360583531103
In that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .	0.12224894844760066
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate .	9.445548676758674
Finally , even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies , there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected , and that is not the intention .	0.008471280596858423
For the reasons set out above , I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax .	0.1558076591985286
At any rate , the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union .	0.07252826081370654
In more direct terms , to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams , this would contravene the Treaty of Rome .	0.024249756149251234
The correct speculative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .	0.013714901756422797
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .	0.009417657257849307
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy experts .	0.31852339948343755
We know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .	0.11024119258339801
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .	0.03579458114665671
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997 .	5.56444504122317
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they are calling for a new burden , they are calling for more bureaucracy , for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary ' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolutions by Parliament .	0.03306759926362704
In my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused .	0.0037822129111061806
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .	12.434120516772172
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?	2.4224463262714546
First , and the Commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets .	0.006177907424709721
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably .	0.29975034339015333
In addition , this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which is one of the central tenets of the internal market .	0.07850027267600004
Secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .	0.028044090503152673
Thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes .	0.029722570807495696
Fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .	0.020646361291723758
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .	13.04643946365935
We need stronger banking supervision .	52.09874473290608
We need to clarify the liability for transactions .	34.12070451590539
We need a framework of regulations at international level .	16.974347936999855
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up .	6.359396117689345
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands .	8.518442667579677
I refer to point 9 .	64.58667977563765
Having listened to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no ' to the Tobin tax .	0.4298632166721613
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say , and I think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the Commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible .	0.2345256239176289
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .	0.03335641128389162
Madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one .	0.04429234718934066
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies .	5.917449177390045
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is .	9.30470013736742
This question has now entered a different dimension , a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments , no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy .	0.12223591318160121
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets , not for the sake of the financial markets , but because this has to do with own growth , our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union .	0.015047238239473395
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past .	6.172764705147309
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises .	0.10647814886704818
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information .	7.109758507875779
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .	10.063678375696218
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .	20.590859042910566
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions .	0.828661781539441
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission , so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure .	1.3666689145394757
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal .	6.375850109549946
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which , although it does not mention it in the text , appears to be an attempt to revive , as the introduction has done , the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin , which our Group opposed , clearly and totally , during the last legislature , with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President , Mr Cox .	0.0
I will have to repeat these arguments , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue has arisen once again .	0.0006347991727966896
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive .	0.15026469314986302
Firstly , there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets .	0.33562609873288435
On the contrary , since it is certain that not all countries would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility , instability , insecurity , opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level .	0.003359030822829042
Furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .	0.007744599901424945
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political , and has no basis or technical viability .	0.15607179167180152
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union , how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level ?	0.5463943122745398
I suppose that the first thing they say will be , 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union ' .	0.45628886627610005
However , the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements .	0.059589853474738656
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively , with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible , not only in terms of its application , but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives .	0.07452245416257466
In itself , globalisation is positive .	0.0002331297337244108
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level .	7.976074853295731
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .	4.705797623982643
Any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political colour or orientation .	0.00010968124107113623
As I have said , we are not opposed to such a study .	0.03798619490861938
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , as this motion for a resolution points out , it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of states and on a general level .	0.02944945635109789
Madam President , Commissioner , the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .	0.003149315499925616
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said , we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic , social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries .	0.1479950276087877
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system .	9.137814638224496
In this respect , Mr Bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax .	0.005397924959622249
If you look carefully , this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets .	0.3086766577635375
Secondly , the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative .	0.10641059097556163
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union , in other words the Commission and also the Council , can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation .	0.22074969166157837
There should be no confusion in this debate .	13.682223044465296
As environmentalists , we do not want an excuse for a motion .	0.0100650270016753
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .	0.3604532631871785
We do need to obtain , from the Commission and the Council , in other words from each of the governments forming the Union , a clear , positive or negative , political stance .	8.375399556336964e-05
They must indicate whether they are ready to defend , within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance , the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system .	0.1516447486211827
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets .	0.5652654837949855
This argument is therefore not relevant .	37.7990709864725
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments .	9.602197355975802
However , I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .	0.002991627884657305
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund .	5.197102445742902
We therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion .	0.036913844316816
Madam President , my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today , particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about .	0.03263348373399167
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning .	5.853835778381519
Having said this , our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents .	0.137238597274536
This invites the Commission to present a report within six months .	13.51840741608253
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative , even if it does so timidly , on this subject .	0.010040184610142104
However , I agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 were challenged , this motion would clearly lose its substance .	0.0013613067047983688
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising .	9.86157896737905
What are the respective places of people and finance in today ' s economy ?	2.3884857580177727
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets .	9.115959991950794
This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .	6.054275626262027
By putting finance at the helm , this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere .	0.1899430868907835
It has led to a growth in mergers , acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .	0.29030762105000274
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .	17.876972267116066
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries , to the point of collapse , as in Asia , Russia and Brazil .	0.01151775036169641
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets , demand , as our motion recognises , is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world .	0.020660786500166874
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information .	5.794871065607743
In this respect , all ideas deserve to be considered , including the Tobin tax which is important , just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged .	0.0036662421833928015
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy .	7.991617651387952
It could release new resources for investment in people and , at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year , it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs .	0.12274779822016797
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators .	0.8598089371885063
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this .	5.945299185342569
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like Mr Dsir and several other speakers , I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .	0.16915380270627164
In any case , the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone .	0.5740260997102155
Madam President , I too am delighted that we are having this debate .	0.012925713865138914
I only regret that it has been so long in coming .	14.931184765433068
We know that each generation has , over the course of time , blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology .	0.02180970401846881
This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism , but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations .	0.43348128750393644
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or , rather , the big mistake of our fin de sicle .	0.01707644772365737
This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or , before that , the certainty , elevated to the status of a dogma , that the earth was flat .	0.002534348158012216
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or , I could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work .	0.026089014331999442
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation , the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals .	0.5743768751567584
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man , the rich as much as the poor .	0.2775632420455017
Yet it is the latter who , at the end of the day , are excluded from the majority of the world ' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently , and very aptly , by Jean-Pierre Chevnement as the globalised lites .	0.012124427777879686
It was natural that these lites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre , thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible .	0.50818155047302
However , the people are fighting back , as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit .	0.004130025215250873
The leaders of the world , headed unfortunately by the European Commission , rushed forward submissively , hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world , Mr Clinton , would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table .	0.0013696303011054944
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies , both individuals and States .	0.1191500304891282
This reaction was more organised than previously , due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular .	0.5617181507874058
The creation of this taxation , of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Laur , could prove to be politically opportune , at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate .	0.01890379353474316
This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States .	4.87710914778693
Madam President , although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support , introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union , as the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death knell for the European currency markets .	0.007839260288001979
If the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax , the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas .	0.6212428990346806
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate .	9.091574306079956
It is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries .	0.5434328366326971
There should therefore be a universal application : it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved .	0.2304641015018232
On the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking , I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried .	0.22619271252195097
Furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .	0.027563620459992878
The world ' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used , for example , for a variety of well-meaning , UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them .	0.018200897133170447
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation .	0.5738721416187677
For that reason , as Mr Karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .	0.06774914139071816
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .	0.35992807918222713
Although it seems a reasonable scheme , the Tobin tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which I do not believe there will .	0.009516945951712107
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .	0.014652659110699231
For that reason , the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .	0.0637630202590362
If this 'feedback ' mechanism , which gives users the opportunity to make choices , were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax , mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it .	0.09227858111726561
Hence , as Mr Karas has stated to his credit , our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax .	0.012950701825792338
Madam President , I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders .	0.09456006691985641
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary .	12.331020266486135
In the last 30 years , the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times : firstly , total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350 , that is , 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation .	0.00376150862396623
The size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .	0.12520491920536772
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .	0.0061207767242479425
The only arguments against it are : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America .	0.010587856099315882
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy .	7.4856081634362015
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders .	0.2389058898975976
Of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .	0.004197738981482496
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .	1.575518097051076e-05
I am disappointed in the EPP .	31.785107244752044
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .	7.289090225484147
Yes , I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .	0.015229475310398486
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .	0.7291286077614609
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .	0.6253881289709827
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind .	19.002845119897316
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK , according to a recent survey by War on Want .	0.26909949992351095
In France it has had enormous resonance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty .	0.4817461412054716
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission .	0.04841893619887228
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : "It has not been done before" .	0.31545142955484096
In the new millennium , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past .	0.014928519459349145
Madam President , Commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules .	0.02384746679755557
I have two or three points to make in this respect .	10.524870733463901
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this is not by chance .	0.0031526288116997727
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism .	5.583654263093037
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects .	5.511894537817373
The Members on the right should note this .	23.013573793703074
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle .	0.05555348618087096
In order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries .	0.25094506874053396
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south .	7.045205772606045
Madam President , we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , Commissioner , that 80% of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days .	0.0012089700124052315
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares .	5.247939116395827
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .	8.299743611540878
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly .	7.622291509891024
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea .	1.502842627375738
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations .	7.6106708827699014
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable .	40.004796211194076
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries , the other EU Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax ?	0.003893446639788477
There must be an overriding economic interest .	28.52424173471072
Why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so-called cash transactions , currency futures and options ?	0.00040823595059442805
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive .	4.597517608104511
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St . Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold .	0.15992026404013893
Madam President , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago .	0.003834272868111733
We are looking for solutions .	75.95553104132065
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .	10.664637748943045
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .	14.008018473275383
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation , the more rules are needed" , as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle .	0.017324348273528026
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations .	6.886453992199654
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions .	0.5527099294581422
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .	16.227309088415456
To continue would be economic suicide .	34.66191371514377
Honourable Members , Commissioner , it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector , but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .	0.0030602300680809967
If we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability ' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment .	0.09362126056704544
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities , the two main market stability indicators , have , for some time , been at danger levels , as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates .	0.0016769113721918805
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains .	5.973516686195026
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are , in turn , generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious .	0.008264162061231631
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .	0.00042038767174290873
The danger is too great for us to ignore .	20.952715303679362
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .	11.883606292767833
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .	0.457406373378953
That is what we are lacking , Commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .	0.004992036252875635
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of , or for this fatalist approach towards , market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasliba I Bhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin .	0.20457284946845433
Madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable .	9.551444589482259e-05
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means .	8.694717022408577
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .	10.108554372588777
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into Switzerland .	0.003175577029850607
We all know that ! But now I call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital .	0.05397312465232204
It has never been done in south-east Asia , it has never been done in Europe , and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber , given Austria ' s financial record .	0.014294376588463286
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush ! We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .	7.060109367629897
Madam President , I am totally appalled by the Commission ' s , i.e . Mr Bolkestein ' s , political ignorance ! He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all ! Madam President , I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .	0.0026628090206886747
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades .	3.7543060713704905
If we continue down this path , and this is the ideology , and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions .	0.09841749443112799
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested .	6.456794474996731
We have asset inflation of global proportions .	25.246756796129375
As a result , speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardises the entire economy .	0.0001962456164022474
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .	8.09230233431362
We can take action against this ; it is possible .	0.012899047817169712
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe .	0.036680281649005234
That too is feasible .	100.68510968992837
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble ! It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .	5.394317952557135
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored .	5.986587944896913
In short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results .	0.09476521559042839
Madam President , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .	0.0009201586474896292
The tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .	0.05536945824974756
Who is going to defend these speculators , when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?	0.05588825874734465
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions .	13.292742552036335
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres , the tax havens , of which there are 62 in all .	0.019579782615565176
The Union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .	0.10721660116640315
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems .	14.534796162354066
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .	7.706929762925033
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .	0.27865305781316524
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .	0.02385676967216718
In the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .	0.10513423723562212
Ladies and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative elite have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system .	0.4046516349584282
Madam President , may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and , above all of course , Mr Dsir , for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening .	0.0005708767242828782
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it is evident that it is an important one .	0.1989922225028707
This is why it has been around for years , and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response .	0.4346521395059224
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament , Mr Gasliba .	0.14571601307743318
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and I share his view .	0.0750763158638693
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which , so far , have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and , as far as I am aware , no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade .	0.015343296047727785
In other words , as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasliba , globalisation is , in my view , positive , and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years .	0.0015468474620125448
A second remark made by Mr Gasliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates .	7.954781552385772
I think that he is correct in this regard .	18.996222731924632
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates .	6.815607584741347
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why I am reiterating them here .	0.2142981950327774
Madam President , could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other ?	0.21102934771209805
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement .	7.865242673093777
Madam President , I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting , in conjunction with my offices and colleagues , to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe , thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible .	0.005291219276784227
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market , I am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .	0.0007755922511307997
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .	0.004967699236310526
Once again , the Tobin tax is , in my view , at odds with the Treaty of Rome , and this is an important , theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening .	0.0003983570129757279
Madam President , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations , there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax , as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers .	0.0044745649863822245
It has unfortunately been observed , I have to say , that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures .	0.011635443446320852
This indicates how difficult these dossiers are .	23.37533268290872
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally , I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .	0.48862512276473513
I think that this will be problematic .	47.58189656212496
Madam President , Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets .	0.08828118598351747
I think , however , that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes .	0.00388946607806171
I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when , as already stated , the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome .	0.12360132525504532
In order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .	0.251178012642887
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance ' ?	2.2085552248294555
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates ?	3.2171482032351753
That the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?	0.00040806655404033526
That is not always the case .	34.0777485923875
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first .	0.6557842323783344
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by Mr Gasliba I Bhm , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .	0.050812684149858685
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the IMF .	0.2318036728645195
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring , on the one hand , that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that , on the other hand , there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses .	0.008569767620555604
Madam President , according to various Members of your Parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .	0.004143506399986907
For example , Mr Kreissl-Drfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects ' - this is an obvious issue .	0.10222627870193102
My reply to this is that , firstly , countries should honour their pledges , namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation , so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose , namely contributions to development cooperation , and not via an artificial and probably harmful route , namely the Tobin tax .	0.0012173552350007374
Madam President , I should like to leave it here .	0.0037698400271960904
As far as the resolution is concerned , of which I have seen a draft , the Commission will await the vote and will , based on this , determine its stance .	0.0007526394695011428
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .	7.832770435870889
I have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .	0.15508352220904179
Madam President , unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language .	0.029565101800529407
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath .	0.4521733563127553
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ?	3.380231303831868
Monsieur Bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque chose ! Unfortunately , my Dutch is not as good as yours .	0.005560785494750799
But I would rather like to say something else to you .	14.772416220625804
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission .	6.370703948853579
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax .	16.05300830542338
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this .	7.135071274161697
From a political point of view , I always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things ! It is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .	0.003267499516153578
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament .	7.443582054295849
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .	0.060698744821006734
We can do so without going off at other tangents .	15.034300169464556
I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .	8.477147060538206
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the Tobin tax ! Madam President , an omission appears to have been made .	0.0622884304554472
In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE , ELDR , GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coteaux .	0.03274879090012235
Mr Dsir , I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .	0.029205953204068727
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled , it will be included .	0.1382263546650015
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m . (The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m. ) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President , I simply wanted to pass on some news .	0.0005886077592896788
There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid .	17.7634010717891
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died .	13.394042038403514
On behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist acts .	0.055726927741810726
Thank you , Mrs Fraga Estvez .	0.0005203871684890227
We had heard about this regrettable incident .	25.24675746240723
Unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society .	0.04496968144945735
I note your comments with particular keenness , as you may expect , given that I too am Spanish .	0.005718677170323502
(The Minutes were approved ) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 21 January 2000 .	0.3168679979670478
Madam President , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy .	0.0797346625578285
Two years ago , in Cavalese in Italy , an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits , causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans .	0.02378034437822623
Since then , the victims ' families , who have not had the consolation of justice , since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges , have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least .	0.0024219612161187716
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S . authorities , and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims ' families .	0.056172502954954635
Mrs Angelilli , thank you .	1.088434670283821e-05
I have taken note of your comment .	21.257819992933978
Agenda The next item is the order of business .	14.908761030794441
Following a request to this effect , which I have received from a number of political groups , and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held , I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance , pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure , on the subject of the European Union ' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government .	0.04708735131770991
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council , and Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission .	0.0009952230331889478
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?	1.7859492448265037
Madam President , I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents , and , since I publicly criticised the presidency in January , I would like to take this opportunity to say , both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group , that we now find the presidency ' s statements on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form .	0.001379906613910737
Madam President , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure .	0.13797311509382973
This debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .	0.02131998903358642
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .	17.516407378661736
(Applause ) Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?	1.55907324525814
Madam President , I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties , and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.053782854850379015
Madam President , until now we believed that the European Union was , according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities , and subsequently the Union , an association of free , independent , sovereign states .	0.00015737150614204875
Even though many developments cast doubt on this , we did believe , in spite of everything , that this was the case and , more recently , reference was made , albeit half-heartedly , to the principle of subsidiarity .	2.046106471691546e-05
Well , patently , if we do open this debate today , Madam President , as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting , on the basis of Rule 50 , we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments , enabling some other majority in this Parliament , at some future time , to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free , regular , peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State .	0.0
If you ratify .. .	0.001803855490624741
Mr Gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .	7.928945321094438e-06
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed .	11.024674139036406
Madam President , I thought I had three minutes .	0.0024857828221062223
Do forgive me .	154.0714306572117
If you ratify this development , then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union .	0.12083296784686004
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against .	13.839995929528005
I shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .	0.0033660215393437804
(Parliament gave its assent ) This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business .	5.915136695675074
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .	4.775151777094276
Talks in Austria on forming a government The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government .	4.6909559501924845
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council .	0.049625499606387596
Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public .	0.0017984008304697465
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .	14.57833235978801
Firstly , we wish to express our total support for , and our solidarity with , the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States , because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values , and not just the political force , which we have all built together .	0.001911252616949922
In any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party .	0.2443646839083355
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered , and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government , but also at the Socialists , who are European citizens as well , because , at the moment , the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country .	0.00495195658795397
I will say one thing .	46.54890401052087
For many years I was a traitor to my country ; at least that was General Franco ' s view .	0.14958187261696163
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar ' s eyes , and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE .	0.3532761557336243
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , has acted as a guardian of the Treaties .	0.0033752447524673613
However , I would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he described the Commission as a European government .	0.0007734461771898997
A government must have more nerve and more courage .	17.59407603546143
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment .	16.011789388050627
(Applause ) With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler , and given that we have heard contradictory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler , I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House .	0.025627661628053154
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .	0.001935475565143231
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider , who have voted for the clearly democratic options , committed to Europe , and I must point out that Mr Schssel may have been Minister for Finance , but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria ' s integration process .	0.022756545370254965
We should not be so politically partisan .	42.23935773718887
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture .	14.952012692878302
We all took part in it , not just one group .	0.03356345660339372
Therefore , Madam President , I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect , because this type of menace , which we have suffered before in Europe , may not only harm Austria , but it may also spread , and I say this bearing history in mind .	0.0006303219156842849
Therefore , apart from the apology which Mr Schssel has made , offering us all kinds of guarantees , as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich , I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People ' s Party , if it goes ahead with this mad project .	0.008436671279116566
Thirdly , if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance , I can assure you that we can forget the European Union ' s main objective - enlargement - because , if we were Czechs , Slovenes or Hungarians , what would we say , faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter ?	0.0037405536240260324
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence .	12.949175434841022
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .	6.910347541914511
(Applause from the PSE Group ) Madam President , we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union , so that we can uphold them together .	0.04428574574268283
Instead , we have been forced to debate the formal , substantial errors that have been made in the last few days .	0.017069761674456032
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who , with thoughtless words , have bolstered Mr Haider ' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous , riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures .	0.04001570907396789
We have never before seen such serious , clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .	0.16461839826974928
Of course , we cannot violate the founding values of Europe , and in this regard , the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty : he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen , which I , like you , have never heard of because it does not exist .	0.0001462030902969459
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam , Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures , in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6 .	0.13430144679038733
However , up till now , Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation .	0.0017900722369002795
Apart from amounting to interference , the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for .	0.39973174716712195
No political cohesion has so far come about , not even in the fight against organised crime , or in defence of the victims of genocide ; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty ; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union ' s credibility .	0.034240189429606493
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated , but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government .	0.23252712637490583
Otherwise , how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism : will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government , or will Stalin ' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything ?	0.009794088279803225
(Applause from the right ) It is via diplomacy , persuasion , knowledge , and solidarity , and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles .	0.001317104904172291
Bilateral relations involve the States , so the 14 do not come into this .	0.0536110502070454
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking , with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes .	0.5301836804265293
It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions .	16.467486348704668
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region .	5.333511945891362
However , we already knew this .	0.0044899111719795765
However , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union ' s democratic role .	0.6084160527182091
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples , and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights .	0.515735878087833
We believe in Europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union .	0.1486687230258256
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks .	8.00277676862761
We have built a Europe with an unstable market , not a Europe with principles , rights and politics .	0.005882580810749413
And these are the consequences ! Therefore , we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people , thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples .	0.2559767039312827
Madam President , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .	0.004551038487652408
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach .	4.085161822487277
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria .	7.947376420912467
There are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .	0.007470583656963627
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union , then , most certainly , this European Union could not become a member , although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them .	0.004939846807046142
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches , then perhaps we could mention some Member States , such as Italy and France , first and third , respectively , in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court .	0.0025901595815424386
We could mention , my Belgian friends , Belgium and the Dutroux case , the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped , tortured , raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country , where inquiries are bogged down , making no headway .	9.264200010942454e-05
We could , if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested , require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter .	0.010729954741810955
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years , 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten , just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy , Belgium and other European Union Member States .	0.034767104321197936
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice , and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice.. .	0.19065066501698788
(The President cut the speaker off ) Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .	0.00010777046389607844
We cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich .	0.009087805097418921
We also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union .	0.0038772617275377235
My party at home are certainly not racists , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well .	0.38542392230525024
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected ?	2.38446500269701
Madame President , the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament .	0.02415380387304036
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .	8.357399945373768
Your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country .	0.001254310742266543
Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .	0.0010414729930099255
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union .	0.05659230650675569
Madam President , as a representative of the Freedom Party , I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria .	0.014454325036037493
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the stability of democracy .	0.18871543448619219
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it , rightly or wrongly .	0.30521108898370836
The refusal of our government , down through the years , to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War , together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour , have done a great deal to bolster this negative image .	0.01222779494687324
This FP has now entered into a coalition with the VP , due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999 , when the previous government was voted out of office .	0.04771056568384915
This is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .	0.22042277031245386
When the talks between the SP and VP broke down , the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FP for their support .	0.349754816079271
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here ! When we suddenly refused this offer , an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day .	0.7778849371641912
The FP party is established in Austria ' s political landscape .	17.70409360898449
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments .	9.614027898353193
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind , and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SP ?	0.42265395263331973
There is prejudice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle .	0.3253041708409652
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust .	0.04508218152138187
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti ! You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda .	5.16512468132323
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist ! On the contrary , you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did .	0.49405217344613594
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices , you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .	0.47117155886401735
The attacks against Austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people .	5.585294982156395
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest .	9.592932464962544
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour... .	0.002018236231327772
(The President cut the speaker off ) Madam President , to begin with , I would like to make one thing abundantly clear : Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion .	0.029028882398049082
Austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary .	0.3824697023426993
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .	9.775368254955072
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria : there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections , in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found .	0.1989947988029269
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .	18.116689745888316
The Austrian People ' s Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement .	0.07375328450496084
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria .	5.68940273210918
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .	4.88178091979762
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship , many people were perpetrators too , although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt .	0.03380648081558941
The VP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union .	4.151976292853422
My country ' s place is not outside the European Union but in it .. .	0.16171657248127905
... , with all the rights and commitments that this entails ! Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto , and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media .	0.052405978365738556
A declared belief in human rights , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest reappraisal of Austria ' s role in the past , in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century , the holocaust , will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the VP and FP .	0.007081467853396838
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values ! (Applause ) Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it is a black day for Austria and for Europe .	0.06145183555197879
Not even Mr Sichrovsky ' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel ' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that .	5.396791884612505
For the day has dawned : two irresponsible politicians , consumed with a lust for power , are selling Austria ' s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interests , down the river ! (Applause , heckling ) They are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government .	0.0013432644187645088
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one , as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens .	0.6842534850471717
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community , insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives , are grave and also inappropriate .	0.10945570860599718
However , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , Messrs Schssel and Haider and their parties , .. .	0.0018793941382726665
.. .	0.006542285213289657
and that includes their representatives in this Parliament .	12.247886994676042
Mr Poettering , it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am , albeit for different reasons , for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions .	0.007493798340635146
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schssel , you are having to consort with Schssel as he is today and who , as I understand it , was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party ' s summit meeting .	0.03771142942222053
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play , i.e . that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system .	0.04397372631455677
However , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement .	0.00047058081793849093
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices , whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism , who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations , and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism , has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate ! (Applause ) This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured .	0.10179503901930709
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the VP - is sustained rather than kept in check .	6.101673555906413
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government .	8.465310449673185
However , by the same token , there is another Austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FP having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .	0.0018209666938535768
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria ! (Applause ) The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism .	0.9134316529589367
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism .	0.3101540449387305
Please support the Austrian people against this government ! (Applause ) Madam President , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values .	0.004251597207901223
We see this , now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which , as is known , does not respect all these values .	0.0038630923537178587
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified , as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union , meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria ' s .	0.29414523558960215
As Members of Parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever .	0.3028824454980565
It is more important than ever that respect for , and non-violation of , human values and the rights of minorities , including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union , form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU , and , for this reason , the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding .	0.001710262896187968
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .	19.14642960466878
As important is the fact that Austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .	0.45591546963991336
We know that most Austrians respect these values .	22.14280649461904
They have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria .	0.12027895595820565
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time .	5.505013772144086
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy .	11.840167660079079
I also appeal to the Austrian President , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .	0.40319609223539365
Madam President , I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , Francis Wurtz , reminded us of just now .	0.001958894635800426
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jrg Haider ' s party .	5.661216005449011
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because , as you know , we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe , with its economic and social policies , its democratic deficit and the Member States ' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans .	0.014936383668306
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today : this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary .	0.042189395837940354
This danger does not concern Austria , it concerns Europe .	0.029982359208528816
We are talking about us , not Austria .	0.004371797933802998
We know the social causes which contribute , along with unemployment and instability , to fuelling tendencies towards this ; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia , racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism , we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe .	0.013012553699728159
Not only the Alpine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat .	0.029118328927628855
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .	14.424675388407474
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz ; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past .	0.20216765248073476
Now , though , it should follow through with its actions , and the first to follow through should be the Commission , which , however , has been obscure and weak on this , making the value of the presidency ' s position even more apparent .	0.00011303328532177876
This is the change we must impose on the Commission ' s action .	13.71487662556554
Madam President , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples , which opposes fascism , nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people , we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament .	0.002349844340930225
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party , there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms or the rule of law , enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties .	0.009089587599014959
I would , however , like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office , who has been so critical of Austria , has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People ' s Democratic Republic of China .	0.0040633268778265666
Perhaps , in order to strengthen the Union ' s democracy , it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens , while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves " into Europe .	0.030441562829305217
Madam President , we are debating an extremely serious issue .	0.0038987645966512075
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State ' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties .	5.165820555073152
A simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder .	0.40948444262216555
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others , as is written here , revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind , which some historians have described as the century of horrors ; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider ' s manifesto has stirred up once again , to our amazement .	0.023380454904355502
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .	5.0337176879313645
However , that is not the problem .	0.004227929508631091
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party .	6.403014606803395
Our answer to this crucial question is no .	14.811652014454419
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations , leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people ' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests , the Spanish delegation of the People ' s Group of this Parliament , in full agreement with the Spanish People ' s Party and the Spanish Government , clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council .	0.06048647025351489
We agree with its substance , its tone and its scope .	0.047755760049488984
(Applause ) Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you .	4.843024774685319
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided .	11.341397916944636
Therefore , Madam President , the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message , rejecting of the tiger of intolerance , xenophobia and totalitarianism , so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications , renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe ' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price .	0.002893353975513065
(Loud applause ) Madam President , the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again ' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camps , anti-Semitism , heightened nationalism or war .	0.0005782452105094424
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe , and which is still highly topical today .	0.692850617447424
It is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .	0.024819505967548394
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances .	5.834355555109243
It is a Community that is destined to exist , in which , when the main thing is under threat , when values are under threat , all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again .	0.0071615912454926
Let us learn the lessons of the past .	12.68928222256875
In the thirties , when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected , although with a minority , many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and , Mr Poettering , in France , a number of men and women , on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too , thought , 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire. ' They put their own petty squabbles first , and the rest is history .	0.0
We must make a rapid , strong and united response .	0.031375787611705196
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President , Mr Poettering .	0.058473732298994704
We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance .	6.114003274805684
So our response must be rapid and strong .	20.16423585179277
Of course , the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable ; I was almost going to say 'irreparable ' .	0.006315417791770158
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold : using heated words first , in populist , xenophobic speeches , and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually , poisoning them , until the day they start to take action .	0.0010276948772237108
And when that day comes , it is too late .	0.017532109102787144
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late , but we are not at that point : today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point .	0.14959176399346574
We must therefore find a political solution .	26.299631709575905
I support the Council proposals in this , while deploring a certain lack of strength , a certain spinelessness , on the part of the Commission which will , however , have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis , with determination over time , since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy , they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end .	0.0012022850915043822
Our response must be rapid .	40.33321298623188
If today we do not staunchly support the Council , then history will judge us , saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement .	0.026906700409690565
Madam President , I am pleased about the fact that , in Austria , the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes , in my eyes , a huge victory for democracy .	0.0004982519321141066
Let there be no doubt about it : we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother " and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods .	0.7844503492973103
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party , which was condemned by the court , to the post of European Commissioner .	0.1778595525513696
Today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .	0.5051036924472616
Madam President , this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States .	0.031185270967403433
This debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists .	0.0005339219945932963
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of Austria ' s Freedom Party .	0.3488812067929363
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the European Union itself .	0.0019108042779021226
We were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former USSR .	0.0018495215644579281
Even today , surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China ' s Communist Party .	0.1447808097888991
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments , or in German state governments , or even the British government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today .	0.15646504847905324
This , Madam President , is the hypocrisy of the left .	6.178791493561585e-05
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States .	0.37956020476778773
We should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results .	0.0005684228398045968
This requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .	0.14181644266216809
That should be our task , not political posturing .	0.019167968965116532
Madam President , Representative of the Council , Commissioner , a week ago , the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm .	1.4196283014952739e-05
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism .	7.846126468401596
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institutions of the EU , a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas .	0.019893460380034346
Secondly , I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations .	0.2685529014680457
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lom Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours .	6.954179202212721
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .	15.795795029260727
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria .	12.730543039802372
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .	19.673115256450327
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union .	6.760118212872889
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously .	0.21870276783755496
Something has happened .	116.76430993654691
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine .	10.89462397352768
Madam President , as everyone has said , this is a very important day .	0.0002212001851306964
It is the day of the first debate of European political life .	15.57822764562076
And this is not pure chance .	67.62721960044118
I feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe , our institutions , with Austria or Mr Haider ' s party .	0.013284737351061456
It is the meeting of Europe with itself , with its raison d ' tre , with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber .	0.024230190989308446
This Chamber was not made for goods , it was not made for money .	0.06835882213450624
This Chamber , and the European institutions , were build to uphold values , morality and a certain spirit .	7.069927514758375e-05
In the twentieth century , we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk , and morality , values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name : nationalist glorification , populism and the concept of racial superiority .	0.0031978281672921573
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider ' s party , the FP , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .	0.006524819606014768
Reading only one sentence which my friend , Mr Vidal-Quadras , has previously mentioned , "The nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally. " Well , we cannot accept such statements .	1.230885474508904e-05
If Europe has any meaning , and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning , if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning , then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and , whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation .	0.030548961656405017
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament , which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission , must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no , and it must say , Madam President , that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit , and in clear terms declare , without prevarication , its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria , recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that , if you are going to have to say no , then the best time to do so is right at the beginning .	0.0
(Applause ) Madam President , we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other Members too .	0.0006866475541539656
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too .	8.041312507027062
Because what is it that unites us in Europe ?	1.5157152740340203
Surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .	0.006523059844521634
The Austrian Freedom Party leader , Mr Haider , has repeatedly repudiated these values .	0.0006393210064175501
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness .	15.921786096262828
He is a dangerous man .	70.11967368317175
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders .	4.62602737866871
Values should take precedence over power .	39.183076504541155
We deplore , therefore , what is happening in Austria .	1.0058693171071595e-05
In fact , we were shaken by it .	0.001402120179875244
We are extremely disappointed .	107.724325273715
As a last resort , we would ask the VP to look into alternatives .	0.08703991290210829
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty .	7.580239796521782
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right .	10.578723953450474
If , despite this , the coalition goes ahead , we would urge the VP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes , both in word and deed .	0.0027477948819133132
Madam President , Austria awaits a heavy responsibility .	0.002232318649302903
Madam President , it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics , but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics .	0.08208064380922402
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ?	2.7525554487368273
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?	2.974310344811092
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days ?	2.811625637550593
From all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen Haider .	0.03570348412764524
Who would want this to happen ?	1.3458994908438024
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?	2.0649590569637484
Europe is a community of law .	36.46394300364605
Democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold .	0.23181113492575187
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did .	0.031982949985720883
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the Treaty .	0.39967621530072817
It would be politically astute not to isolate the VP but to support it as an undeniably democratic , constitutional and well-known European party , so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that is why we must give the VP our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take ! (Applause ) Madam President , they say , where I come from , 'it ' s three times for a Welshman ' , and three times , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate .	0.0
First of all , could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday .	1.0250501003126176
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission ' s opinion .	0.02048750781185607
I am duty - bound to say to this House , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue .	0.008269122107331528
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday .	0.05913996421643956
Secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria .	0.002017294916842261
Thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld .	0.016351437616143744
There is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .	0.13726690827139226
And , when I say that the Commission took that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning .	0.00016491382575112995
Anyone , therefore , who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world .	0.015523615815818674
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler .	0.07898279123914287
Could I also say , Madam President , that the understanding of the presidency , the Portuguese presidency , for our position , was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said , and I quote him , that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation ' .	0.0020110386441721845
That surely is in everyone ' s interests .	18.280359355199167
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .	0.7525934364298796
We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour .	0.0005037851004225926
That is our duty .	74.69186335578152
It is also a matter of conviction .	63.67337147119958
My final point is this .	35.38458545403965
We understand the context of this essential debate .	29.583706809404873
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider ' s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies , sometimes on successive days .	0.19374450060980156
We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism .	0.13379338220889278
And , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this House , my and my colleagues ' instincts are naturally aroused .	0.0018033252526750711
However , the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct .	0.32022709045655445
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .	12.716217400048452
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law .	9.07075165949109
Without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people .	0.0008120628028145295
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate , 'necessarily with acute vigilance ' .	0.32624625094819304
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government .	0.15995567145745823
Does the Commission support the Council ?	1.6938033120790013
Madam President , when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States .	0.035943059527539796
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .	1.6527613560246768e-05
I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .	0.3634808444855033
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .	0.00013770652879857893
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .	9.638583439758852
The vote will take place at 11 a.m . tomorrow .	0.00032300722568818927
Recourse to the precautionary principle The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .	5.928052629913204
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen .	0.5194048613021726
The precautionary principle is not a new concept .	36.56744582508196
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht .	0.005046802739563225
It also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol .	0.006677069466902624
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear .	24.185317927342275
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear , but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action .	0.48522684959556306
However , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years .	0.11489857581548134
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .	5.784786878872734
In view of this growing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .	0.45632849548268956
The basic aim of the communication is twofold .	27.339779630863283
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles .	0.10470698063217103
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism .	4.918913414766243
The Commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health .	0.0725239929310743
Of course , this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear .	0.031993694597489714
As such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics .	0.0029150013355953453
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society .	6.970101227101746
It is therefore political by nature .	52.20511093678055
However , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .	0.6095839342440371
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .	0.22325965504249354
They must be non-discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .	0.17116929639691197
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .	15.228662426867766
For example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .	0.0008199138977499455
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action ; that is , the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that is the burden of proof .	0.06626591770599984
All these elements have to apply cumulatively .	28.5245682351191
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures , which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle .	0.29265196601992266
For example , a research programme , public information campaigns , recommendations and so on .	1.1782357732087896e-05
Applying the precautionary principle does not , therefore , automatically imply a ban .	0.0005885339263202859
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .	0.06777122699825133
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level .	0.025306701473445457
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .	7.277297393208953e-05
I have three short questions , the first being as follows .	0.028289762695774906
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice .	6.367420253025686
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry , Foreign Trade , Competition and the Internal Market ?	0.012328361952389398
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes " but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?	3.239904196873828
My next question , Mrs Wallstrm , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?	0.00019915672474867213
Lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?	0.023790224599353878
In other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?	0.24112242132701184
.	1.0
Thank you very much , Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , for these questions .	0.00011899210352326673
Of course , this is shared by the whole Commission .	0.003918187624604349
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us , David Byrne , Erkki Liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today .	0.00829253592796164
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission .	5.295064697516819
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .	6.304940890161398
Yes , I would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example .	0.017239598504413922
And , I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .	0.17552667159140223
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas .	0.060223094936934
It has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health .	0.006976371242201253
So , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .	0.11831035356596335
Mr President , Commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence .	0.000889656687332404
Needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .	0.04917736087712573
We might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?	0.04269583126436927
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists .	0.25635266518811495
I would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?	5.6277685744246365e-06
How would you describe this ?	1.2599208727983453
What establishes a recognised minority ?	1.2599207454885868
If a political decision is involved , I would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?	0.0010604424601285084
The Commission ?	1.0
The Council ?	1.0
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ?	3.915368060768774
What is the role of the scientific committees ?	3.525992438192929
What , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?	0.0011399769037739775
Finally , will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?	0.000860886417304544
These are my three questions .	47.18706984030707
.	1.0
Yes , Mr President , that is true .	3.7471594810118447e-06
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but I will try to answer some questions .	0.1544684054669628
Who will take the decision , who are the decision-makers ?	0.0014072920975431176
Well , that depends on who the legislators are .	0.0216320250975865
This is part of risk management .	36.292313976120155
They have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .	0.008256300837717143
However , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .	0.33681569882066165
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete .	10.100458849072215
That is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science .	0.0012922255300492876
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base .	0.34917113997151034
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .	0.2633644810365696
You have to see this as a tool for risk management .	20.24538061347479
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available .	0.009019235864553403
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science .	15.182589870559575
Then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .	0.07807681331928787
So , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today .	0.5782765125426763
Mr President , I have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .	0.006782777028577971
It is about brominated flame retardants .	31.78510802428428
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered .	19.44598894903084
There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment .	8.033411976452554
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are .	0.368803276852775
Recently , both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants .	0.38372434530375893
I am wondering , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .	0.09041879042640731
.	1.0
(SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr Sjstedt , for this question .	2.2402837666809476e-05
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one .	16.517748112522973
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .	5.594485048357602
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .	5.776570520901782
Allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .	0.022375361687914166
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken .	11.001880775308507
It ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .	0.00033766557756347476
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken .	0.07505202327155433
This issue is extremely topical .	54.28448733142048
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .	6.072981616374662
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .	15.630254412119235
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ?	2.7486435673602707
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops .	10.193259901011388
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ?	2.2267964292287434
.	1.0
(SV ) Mr President , I am pleased to be able to tell you that , in Montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety .	0.001471479308660076
We succeeded there in agreeing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .	0.003407133317568744
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .	11.527940106590503
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle .	6.3563464157993925
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted .	12.392352236586689
It is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .	0.00018256477607546604
Mr President , I have two questions .	0.0003007483306669607
I shall try to be very brief indeed .	28.035976673449827
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .	11.808676333659779
As I have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .	0.4161761378737098
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost-benefit analysis ?	0.03410721812329947
In that case , I am rather concerned , because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced .	0.06625881105477703
Instead , the precautionary principle should come first .	0.014348990834918784
My second question concerns the burden of proof .	18.051905335886772
I remember Margot Wallstrm being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee .	8.71257738141395
At that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof .	0.10696965370344756
In other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .	0.17236599465881505
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now .	15.813151317880513
.	1.0
(SV ) Thank you , Mrs Schrling .	0.0033322079750451234
These are two important questions , and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them .	0.24925074940238093
No , one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis .	0.040191595226597425
Instead , the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know , of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals .	0.2935518726984946
When , on the other hand , the decision has been made to take a certain measure , the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness .	0.02821961365318106
It is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis .	0.0009625249972599638
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof .	13.247257427545266
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .	14.148130993208843
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this .	7.032353727527498
There , however , we are concerned with that particular area , whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern .	0.036706616539666816
Therefore , the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context .	0.3237492155212719
Instead , it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this .	0.07588729447199587
It is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof .	2.719968324560853e-06
Mr President , I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible .	0.033398171665129484
I will give an example : a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind .	0.17090219310552413
It is therefore a teratogenic substance .	58.737986596377645
Very well , it is a fungicide , it kills off mould .	9.570781050600917e-05
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests .	0.3727368771955831
Now , in my opinion , given that this is such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market , which New Zealand has done , for example .	0.0005694025960281585
So I want to put this question to you .	16.846793038414592
When human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis ?	0.013054554496002539
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this .	0.1485042995870221
In short , Commissioner , I would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary .	0.0004191016166692461
.	1.0
(SV ) Mr President , no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people ' s health and the environment .	0.9065253109278637
Obviously , I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case .	0.15460201665978215
The truth , of course , is that a great many Member States , and no doubt other nations too , have taken measures to protect their populations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle , even if it has not always been called that .	0.0007805496828606655
Naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided .	0.08286123923919039
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .	5.834348611978223
I think , however , it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken , it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between .	0.010491685327158502
In those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .	0.1594073660302231
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when I was on a visit to Africa .	0.48419839619917987
At a hospice for AIDS patients , I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients .	0.18036430776499748
They were the first to say that , each day , they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there .	0.0263706342217985
We must be very careful about how we use resources .	19.36059261409706
I believe we can learn something from this .	22.669597541908736
We must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help .	0.014769872391029197
As is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis .	0.2551039206077384
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health .	0.5741930575358337
Mr President , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions ! Commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I asked about the other Commissioners , for it may have sounded as though I was in jest .	0.00853413391302781
Indeed you responded in kind , as I knew you would do .	0.04220499409245884
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union .	0.3313965182373664
I have good reason for asking this .	30.190400514633094
As you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence .	0.0006604029361313109
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partners in the USA , on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes ?	0.0645006196796895
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors , keep pulling the carpet from underneath you ?	0.008915860904440902
That is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner ! Mr President , I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons .	0.1669844657713103
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the United States .	0.14333512092174636
We should not be so nave as to think otherwise .	19.703591306710386
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade .	0.038757882741045586
This constitutes a good example , therefore .	0.003197015685453721
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .	0.5880295993100387
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .	0.059262972527398705
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed , so to speak , as more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , as we have been able to establish from the interventions , questions and replies , it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance .	0.00516275991228777
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
Intergovernmental Conference The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000 ) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)] .	0.07357191530928375
Mr President , I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts .	0.10130555829298876
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration .	9.079665576535806
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .	0.26683896486118525
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century .	7.361304198335854
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work .	0.17908999271285664
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work .	6.561699047514484
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit , it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe , one that is more effective , more democratic and more transparent .	0.03200855086128881
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union ' s institutional bodies .	5.672289838356826
I will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .	0.04067015926890289
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved , namely enlargement .	0.9131616114211976
Granted this , the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union ' s institutions .	0.0077753248319532425
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the European public .	0.01680360088897462
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .	5.0250832615355545
At the same time , however , I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform , I repeat , of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism .	0.00046030746862286243
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency , which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end .	1.0432141687158902
All the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.3148098885296713
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union ' s Member States .	6.0727380635463355
In light of what I have said , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you , so that on 14 February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament ' s backing .	0.01327244191081638
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us .	8.04538098389859
Mr President , the Group of the European People ' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki .	0.10851901172495654
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the Union ' s institutions .	0.006163541573540736
In Helsinki , the governments approved the idea that , as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States , a minimal reform would be sufficient .	0.0020820443340802083
With more than 21 , a deeper reform would become necessary .	0.04252206095390227
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States .	6.514296183491507
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .	8.662174606975949
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union .	7.673959610525387
Having said this , Mr President , this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference .	0.014410572818773915
In theory , we could have done so .	0.0009997235344736699
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th .	6.695113156236873
However , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .	0.16009425174358294
Mr President , I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly .	0.174635546757862
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues .	5.910530646387277
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself .	0.29697136348610215
However , the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference .	0.10004163739070863
This is for one very simple reason : according to the agreements made in Helsinki , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues , which are currently decided unanimously , being decided by a qualified majority .	0.0018606037071379141
Therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase .	0.06453217093981553
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament .	5.619104234378534
Therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with Parliament .	0.004368750550022176
However , this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union .	0.2389834674661229
That it is what we are doing .	20.885311170356527
We believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issues need to be dealt with .	0.0022964706263815743
These include , amongst others , the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the Treaty .	0.000437942732512941
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which I believe has started very positively .	0.020517623711405496
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union ' s institutions .	4.962170736455155
Therefore , Mr President , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the Commission , which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents .	0.002965731449620017
We will talk about this on another day .	22.74404494875533
Today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the Group of the European People ' s Party , Mr President , is ready to give that green light .	0.00018031825937750418
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee .	0.22223700962323414
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened .	5.905395148147687
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .	0.21755817976690586
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC .	8.852850877261657
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC .	6.850363375659891
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .	6.981340257122494
They need a political deal .	57.52168431270277
It is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months .	0.015005692356475458
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda .	11.23739396172746
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries .	0.3410372969034429
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree .	32.607255861250636
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .	6.134145113381725
However , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .	9.888316647512482e-06
There is time .	130.05491160520634
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act .	15.836943163075253
It lasted only five months .	47.18706985076328
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year .	8.937213313348314
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason .	4.902960639888336
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .	5.27822491739329
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view .	19.152790486008318
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .	5.6839690944257155
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said .	0.005356292172487503
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .	10.863417405989797
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that .	6.078187301898319
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC .	8.0442077992042
That is all to the good .	25.83462518536078
The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .	0.06867066731339976
I wish you every success , President of the Council , in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine ' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency takes over , by the end of this year .	0.03128916809552335
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted .	11.079280037964065
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .	6.533349592245423
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .	0.02003803849691718
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty .	0.09295260384010266
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty .	6.628572639344396
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court .	12.348465456972523
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention .	16.448192361239126
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy .	4.631873494833642
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .	6.949848069438132
Mr President , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament ' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council , and in the end , makes it rather irrelevant .	0.029608558474409165
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion , and frankly , we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine ' s day , the first day of the Strasbourg part-session .	0.0926853278070919
Moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .	0.00033779464491170595
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .	9.649061339958987
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States .	4.561233920052024
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that , in any case , the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and rectify the course of events .	0.07112256818549383
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference , and I firmly hope that this opinion , that was given reluctantly , will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise , but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament .	0.060134032236880006
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , to my mind , it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful .	0.013977879115703017
After all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that is to say , we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States , and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future .	0.01045087932447505
How , though , is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i.e . before enlargement takes place ?	3.7540725059148724e-05
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference .	9.379922695056809
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future .	6.046418443245559
My group , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs .	0.009378637109354299
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand .	5.273565501434165
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe , and , in particular , a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs , because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians .	0.007210362145929962
The politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all .	0.15282346541587039
That is why we need transparency .	60.63200771157623
I believe it falls to you , as President-in-Office of the Council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties .	0.02707101202294067
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .	0.20622978625891372
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda , once the Intergovernmental Conference is over , whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future .	0.25861003390070897
In this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .	0.26046814233887966
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to .	7.641319231275521
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter .	0.15133950115303188
After all , what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ?	0.11594969331267402
No , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union .	0.09943758455396144
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .	9.111107132034673
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union .	0.32577511911080964
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens , and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year .	0.6676414983768354
Of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States .	0.05962329122378534
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the Council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .	0.028594194155776735
We need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States .	0.028585417294982395
This is something I would stress , particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States .	0.23318881627289992
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament , on all the issues you have raised .	0.5550466286615154
There is one final issue I would like to raise .	15.734892515379785
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy .	12.234192321613783
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes .	0.8326887043308471
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union ' s policies to date .	7.9859498825340784
It is all about creating a socially just Europe .	18.55977594485536
A socially just Europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union ' s policies .	0.7148967319119297
Hence , to my mind , that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty , which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition .	0.010704322364520761
The same applies to Article 105 , in my view , for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty , of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment .	0.01544507627558714
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , as set by the Helsinki Council , i.e . focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe , must be adhered to .	0.00098100631180737
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .	0.01409663747082197
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission , which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and , what is more , widen it in the wrong direction , i.e . moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system .	0.004511613785958269
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution .	0.007159671088630378
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .	7.307981509878617
We deplore the fact that the Commission , in its opinion of 26 January , limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East , a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions .	0.01749936100017454
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this is a totally superficial concept .	0.25840682205612253
Quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding .	0.0028964010459566363
Furthermore , the centralised European system , as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation , erodes nations and , in eroding nations , erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves .	0.0022700960653628606
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending .	0.35089293277218203
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised , i.e . by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty .	0.06304454186000574
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the European Parliament and the Commission .	0.003061340302931974
A flexible Europe , is a Europe which respects its national democracies , which relies on the support of its nations , its national patriotisms , instead of continually persecuting them .	0.0008520429248047147
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the constraining , convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .	0.08032620571909864
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament ' s opinion is .	0.40756632296982664
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration .	6.824183593342094
I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group , but it is no coincidence that the European Council ' s decision is supported by those who are , after all , in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration .	0.08102349831111826
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council .	11.22458990687438
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine ' s day .	6.478979216464419
In any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda .	0.04569180885759284
This message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .	0.13884643938518854
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content .	0.4217321492108056
Just consider the facts : we looked at Austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , Mr President : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , I will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues .	0.001280516133496748
There is clearly a more ambitious goal .	30.1903822609077
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done , i.e. , that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty .	0.04289504992582169
We know that there are other topics : for example , many Members have subscribed , along with us , to the issue of the seat of the institutions , an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level .	0.0009112018961894131
In conclusion , I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once , so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency , this agenda will be revised .	0.006743065455809896
Otherwise , the challenge really would be lost , not just for the present but also for many years to come .	0.009507324801055131
Mr President , the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.05892797723308336
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but , in the Commission ' s draft , plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market .	0.10989411958745153
This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels , even if a unanimous French National Assembly , a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this .	0.23158576378843207
And , in this regard , you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people ' s social conditions , which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls .	0.016044058199343215
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .	7.9425357598541595
Brussels knows best .	191.93154808051537
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the European Ombudsman .	0.0063941281569319134
Today , the Commission is obliged , on a case-by-case basis , to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people ' s demands for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the Commission ' s regulation is adopted , the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration .	0.0006310675885022564
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States .	5.126463433653315
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency " , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public .	0.21559883326873566
It is , of course , thoroughly Orwellian .	4.694290873327013e-07
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .	0.04174806379063327
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission ' s possession .	0.8437726507113077
There follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions .	4.014211943964782e-05
The French text contains the word "refuse " and the English text the word "shall " , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country .	0.0991737452709606
In addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever .	0.012059415943048445
It is therefore .. .	0.000828855397076777
(The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Portuguese Council Presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness .	0.10962167367813831
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve .	8.54899009717657
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament ' s motions are anything to go by .	0.7671550243497758
There is more to be said on that score .	21.690643017988247
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .	0.019375646734497088
In the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens .	0.2511330757526829
At the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union .	0.2830986053874531
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .	5.830560779223623
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade .	8.735366204461094
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union ' s being able to function come what may .	8.060569215122197
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which entail changes being made to legislation .	0.020075151048456287
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area .	9.561442475712573
In addition , we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area .	0.03575212507733927
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .	0.055157589768226274
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann , I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank .	0.42412957142600793
However , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .	0.10135891672287352
Furthermore , the tripartite relationship of Commission , Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case , especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures , for which the Commission alone has responsibility .	0.006749418551105321
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .	8.455952819271966
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference .	5.282661273438151
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .	0.11300404272566676
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to .	7.857629238602774
The debates we are having these days , on a certain European country ' s government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing , and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial stabilising factor .	0.0
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights .	5.871127223869577
The European Union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences .	0.00016880630462197654
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .	7.976072572046967
For this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty .	0.010203166858216879
In my view , that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on .	0.15093868755066353
If we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union .	0.19256982882494408
This is the crux of the matter .	18.851073377529524
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage .	0.17669562378896628
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .	0.12015087337135981
(IT ) Mr President-in-Office , on listening to the various interventions , you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament ' s political groups , the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency , instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.04077211989250029
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this , last week in the Committee I chair , but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager .	0.13895613799693035
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .	0.5811317415840571
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and exacting delegations .	0.7658357963451092
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .	6.643382501126739
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union ' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table .	5.125527676169364
However , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.23989549076775124
Yesterday , we also discussed the Commission , represented by Commissioner Barnier , who gave its opinion .	0.0001104677975604464
This effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , Mr President-in-Office , you also expressed different views .	0.0001808275118381606
Nevertheless , we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe , a risk that was , moreover , indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one ' s attention , owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors .	0.001911077907947932
We must , therefore , ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today , with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles , values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union , with regard , among other things , to running the economy .	0.003820086991460919
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.5391752342455459
Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement .	0.005860785341951614
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction .	10.725819548789868
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened IGC agenda .	0.0016880639699020639
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this Parliament .	0.0038229675841735776
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book .	10.725821818232447
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC .	10.800196840542087
In many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights .	0.07900675402066634
An essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this Parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty .	0.023900989124060034
Of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .	0.02426690695482009
What is the Commission ' s verdict on this ?	3.3710165453221683
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the Commission .	0.02331064647243835
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission .	5.168398520265743
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States , but we owe them to ourselves .	0.1594133496403747
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire .	0.29565954694628455
Mr President , there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament .	0.009796065008053962
It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation .	27.132775583843536
After having restricted , on its own initiative , its participation in the IGC to two minor seats , Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC .	0.01095698222535516
The fact is , whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way , you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion , Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it , i.e . demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion .	0.004110488389655154
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 February , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the Council .	0.0001884404299647199
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today .	11.451300117182628
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues , since in our haste , with blameworthy naivety , we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda .	0.0009053813756822919
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .	0.5356710737753798
Whether we want it or not , since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates , the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union .	0.11619236429169012
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority , those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers , to take up their pilgrims ' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended , since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council .	0.12801344894557978
Because of the situation in Austria , this is a dark day for Europe .	0.045647025371236216
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .	0.3117773869456301
In order to assert our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this IGC , I believe we owe Europe a constitution .	0.0002793824379573095
Mr President , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions .	0.003294910067363328
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this .	11.703278680279034
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement .	24.872030285226085
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement .	6.646580754461898
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .	3.7697008368931093
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level .	6.53986995389305
It is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .	0.005388121129987224
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank .	6.458555781536614
This is untenable .	191.93154808051537
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic , the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered .	0.23014048538339987
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity .	5.558182764075003
Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible .	14.083205170066531
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective .	5.0092979923113665
Article 56 of the Treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control .	0.07330602518004938
In the majority of EU countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats .	0.08219641020964867
It is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union .	0.03173620775362398
It also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital .	0.003103730566181525
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference .	9.462303817010325
It is , however , important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States .	0.0030108902853514985
It is the Member States ' parliaments , or people voting in referenda , who are to direct the development of the Treaty .	0.012988941494328155
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .	8.67513089045382
Mr President , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it .	0.004591884945951903
Nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right .	0.6757647492380229
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .	0.002862842342257365
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution .	13.244927273573397
The amendment of the Treaties was , however , limited to a review of some internal rules , which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is Europe , what are its common principles and therefore , its objectives and limitations ?	9.26244708707366e-05
However , politics exacts its revenge , and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of Austria , since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and forms of racism .	0.0013370018407349931
And it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this .	0.07626181382882098
I belong to a world , the world of Liberal Catholics , which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values , and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values .	0.021975926022124396
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights , in a European Constitution , then we shall construct a Europe without a solid , lasting base .	0.03807621572250846
Commissioner Barnier , I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe .	0.058576009274320114
Mr President , I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which , looked long and hard at , threatens the whole of democratic Europe .	0.03300564473658224
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU .	4.328581397482955
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles .	7.620724174533323
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country , Denmark , takes it for granted that , when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union , we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth , that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe .	0.029685810870660228
However , that is precisely what is happening .	0.007319985791361186
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU , we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth , and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating , especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth .	0.06901109360885352
In the light of developments in recent days , it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State ' s democratic process .	1.0665381062255979
You can think what you like about Mr Haider , and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process .	0.08898069012075413
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty , we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time , sometimes in contravention of the Treaty , as we have just seen .	0.015511041697496723
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon .	14.516044203016449
On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 .	0.296868891545549
This is a big task but it can be done .	16.620531560719854
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement .	5.366304030777178
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers " .	10.366144967661656
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe .	4.34779860406317
In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining .	0.8796411982802386
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission .	0.44705570841770526
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point .	7.973092431951389
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution .	0.4406388992216924
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty .	5.230166992070598
In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions .	0.29023326170692887
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .	16.51961941374772
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents .	10.650355733222828
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe .	0.05318238354327129
Mr President , I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution , which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible .	0.07463820882720007
In any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon .	0.06109403328489094
I think that , under the present rules of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .	0.01378602467964698
On the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .	0.03754551786953586
We must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .	0.09146896323241972
That way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms .	0.06701411323201314
Parliament ' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that , with the Union ' s institutional changes , we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union .	0.12375463206375993
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone .	8.478042585389458
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive .	12.80823857607908
It may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .	0.29282398626727346
I will mention two point that may create tension .	17.59407212293389
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .	7.75517204589881
Europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state .	0.0324687205185136
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union , which is a union of states and peoples .	0.18474457259031393
The other area of conflict is more difficult .	16.378452945243957
Owing to the imminent increase in membership , the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective .	0.2021201919177644
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .	14.775705766821066
By its very nature , however , the European Union is , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution .	2.571653253951996e-05
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist .	16.95735527075377
Of course they do , but they are not unlimited .	0.02736030195252003
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer .	0.31513214643511145
I am , however , optimistic .	1.1619338844835597e-07
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened .	0.008458313459499916
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union .	9.78665905464696
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union , which will , however , be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned .	0.01206320331852851
The Commission ' s former president , Jacques Delors , has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation .	0.013007337420149449
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions , for the sake of clarity .	0.6284963574112171
The Commission ' s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .	7.092015832543243e-05
Last November , the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe : the onion skin model .	0.04702453650313243
In the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility .	0.29653276341532914
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party .	0.502188716023559
My colleagues , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken , somewhat sceptically , about some aspects of the matter in hand .	0.00045095512465556935
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions .	0.570285814429021
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .	10.449540761594275
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament .	8.444233088800864
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly .	6.010035410464837
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality , six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants , you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales , which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom .	0.025987533126676864
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have sixteen .	5.696466652932603e-05
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26% more population over time , and then adopt the Commission ' s , I think ill-considered , proposition , that there should be a European list of candidates .	0.0014563353800197353
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ?	0.009270774454176353
It will become totally invisible ! Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions , people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones .	0.9929468638500631
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view .	12.222259108708796
Mr President , to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new .	0.05807632964527984
It has been said many times .	33.262988136339374
This time , however , it is true .	1.1752049012194765e-06
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement .	13.434297564835346
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .	10.01490621043146
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?	1.5873998046349531
That is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its method .	0.013057184110816935
It is clear that the Council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place .	0.00467574060390747
That puts enlargement in danger .	41.39752974110676
It jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .	0.0028144975229449248
The Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further .	0.07089756055697648
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion .	11.937890211055231
We want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one .	0.014246148769446873
Must there be an IGC ?	1.2599209741589212
Of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference .	0.041332918289566006
The agenda must go much further .	25.99276930826674
We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .	9.421582496182438
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .	0.5150783150009604
We must clearly set firm objectives .	35.93104899915025
The functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse .	0.03260012238270027
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point .	10.678074223781849
Have we achieved results ?	1.1486982213219905
Yes , but the point is to make a qualitative leap and , speaking in political terms , this , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment .	0.0017099997493721748
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the House , at this stage , following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi .	0.02806920598522321
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work , your two rapporteurs , Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus , if this opinion were adopted , the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February , as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency .	0.0006794305561053485
As far as we are concerned , after producing the opinion expected from the Commission , according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty , we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated .	0.010053077124854613
We know , I know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .	0.0016169127885106314
I would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups .	0.4801273702066125
Firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .	0.027570107899447447
I understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet I feel , as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate .	0.008061856783698798
Indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the Commission framed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines .	0.0023084523228344873
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label .	0.00023076333973591425
I do not like the term 'leftovers ' any more than Richard Corbett does .	12.39925811905276
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects , and difficult , so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth .	0.131692201717638
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though I do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now .	0.22397238687885393
They are the first but they are not the only subjects , Mr Seguro , that the conference must deal with .	0.00546420756625669
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement .	0.01095001612687174
We are ready for it , whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , on which work has started , the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations , or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work : reorganisation of the Treaties .	0.0058148641679949525
I have heard many comments on the Commission ' s opinion , which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth , with specific indications of new draft articles , but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate .	0.04209449845088553
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate , by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers .	0.5736519417243006
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings , I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok , are going to be working .	0.017337040099068418
Of course , the final trade-offs will be made , as in any institutional negotiations , and I think this is no bad thing , at Council level , especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands .	0.0012423107421289559
Let me point out , in passing , that the Commission President , Mr Prodi , is also a Council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , alongside the Heads of State and Government , particularly during the final period .	0.00012897943116349674
However , these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared .	0.017241307266094453
This preparatory work , this fine-tuning , must not be omitted , ladies and gentlemen of the House .	8.672927126445964e-05
I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limited to technical details .	0.4040697992976723
I think that all of us , the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs , your two representatives , and myself , as a representative of the Commission , will be going into matters in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participating , that the last trade-offs must be made .	0.00016216928008170342
Throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .	0.004047449416488798
And once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament , prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations .	0.030628396344771498
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as I am concerned , in my current position , I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations .	0.029520738206205994
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be .	7.888770867786814
We now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the House , your next opinion , in which you will specify Parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations .	0.0002724470489446776
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations , the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other , alongside the Council members , explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually , every day , what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest .	0.02507794027523827
In the coming months , ladies and gentlemen of the House , the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation , on good terms , with your two representatives , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok , in order to reconcile our points of view , if need be .	0.0002264524881598102
Quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same .	0.02399033545235288
There will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .	0.04884126756469274
The important thing is that we are consistent , and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner .	0.4035541573714325
Our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully .	0.002915439907344819
This will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union .	0.022054100598176963
Finally , I should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , Mr President .	2.317824217096846e-05
Firstly , to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate .	0.008347881098125226
Such dialogue between the national parliaments , the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important .	0.0538534952446083
I have said , furthermore , that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments .	0.003298880857138242
Tomorrow , I shall be in London .	0.006964299537240547
In a fortnight ' s time , I shall be in Berlin .	0.03799505529531169
In three weeks ' time , I shall be in Paris , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .	0.011911748820865067
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for taking it .	0.1720432207232544
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency , particularly Mr Seixas da Costa , for his proactive approach .	0.007388050533235149
Indeed , the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency .	0.04154156006900752
It will have to initiate these negotiations .	31.62767033494525
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000 .	0.6290725410517769
Not only that a conclusion can be reached , but that a successful conclusion can be reached , which is not necessarily the same thing .	0.010658861227777603
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .	22.275361424938907
The handover will have been made , but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made , by yourself , Mr President , and by the Portuguese Presidency , are going to be extremely important , as is the nature of this handover .	0.00018647840355208778
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important .	0.005227510308472855
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency ' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectations thereof .	0.3486361680003106
Portugal is a small country , but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions .	0.22908380332278044
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .	0.08671959325464246
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months .	11.397515701063114
Finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations .	0.022745024195634025
These are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .	0.2102089361274525
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament , Ministers , Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate .	0.00222504922329026
As far as the Commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate .	0.0008035948927991407
Cross-border services The next item is the joint debate on the following reports : A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD) ; A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS) .	0.03523737995161182
- (DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today , but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do .	0.009511499201350632
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today .	0.3742397108248718
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis .	5.7898800244182125
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees , I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst .	1.2256396824596998
These have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits .	0.025401951563804877
However , the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue .	0.622087868799857
Furthermore , not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice ' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services ; barriers that are often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller companies .	0.02290173672375963
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services .	5.2981668622759175
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .	22.06787663201603
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises .	9.937890035162024
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement .	8.073773706197402
All provisions , i.e . issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights , should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services .	0.0022197368651476557
I , together with the European Parliament ' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view , as expressed in the report produced by the Council ' s Legal Service , is inappropriate .	0.01791914375510349
Consequently , I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .	0.688451378227084
I also believe that Parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission ' s proposal .	6.545437356198619
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council , and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense .	0.4588761455058474
When it comes to acceptance by the Council , I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals .	0.11020632869875745
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis .	10.473665919095113
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract " system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract .	0.06253893975198287
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .	10.694384677077942
However , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued , and as the Commission ' s proposal would have it , more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued .	0.00804530015339467
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter .	0.9339831305877652
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident .	4.87141714546507
Likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure .	0.05652031019560251
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States , rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States .	0.7132017206400694
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .	14.452446972192375
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months , and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting .	0.8372982980197075
However , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .	0.2893834366908799
When it comes to self-employed persons , in addition to the amendments already described , we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment .	0.04480971371988687
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .	5.24380749574967
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .	0.19675876187172267
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions .	6.521932023849673
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament ' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them .	0.034439931934443065
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .	4.395530444736382
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons .	6.360840377189084
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i.e . the correct way to quote .	0.03664447358960517
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .	7.700476331671375
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports .	10.748810612432482
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously , and I would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions .	0.28485772798285736
On a final note , I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports , which were far from easy to produce .	0.042088338572117995
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention , for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report , contributing excellent and constructive ideas ; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur .	0.09489113069256279
That is why he deserves special mention ! .	29.602146907063364
(NL ) Mr President , I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger ' s speech , after which I will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speakers .	0.007928366861514897
If you allow me , Mr President , I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate .	0.011731745171516577
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees , the topic of the debate .	0.6403398748759159
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .	6.438686286184868
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .	4.311808986990866
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .	7.657339505904484
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , Member States , the procedure would be more flexible still .	0.0013751495016351926
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .	8.975234008028934
However , I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State .	0.25417518424503777
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice .	5.268735237513025
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market .	4.3242289755324546
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .	6.298542020293998
Indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too .	0.39254858417658284
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification .	8.369008407488225
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired .	6.723161276110214
Following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided .	0.36907479045545805
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio ' s Amendment No 22 in both respects .	10.783513310015781
As far as the second proposal is concerned , the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal .	0.6678823812132169
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .	13.71902256126363
I hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments .	0.004182597665129411
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amended version .	0.04868006340332619
I propose to confine my comments to two areas .	16.34368086348734
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .	0.22799888134435045
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .	13.131223349534393
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment .	9.06492276604421
Then there are the interests of the Member States , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .	0.002737067719066434
If we are going to abide by the one extreme , that is the interests of the Member States , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high .	0.11918462994908983
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .	12.326059236976162
If I were to go to the other extreme , as few hurdles as possible that is , then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive .	0.18267315808615636
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high , in reality no one would apply for the card .	0.14319454829505718
Alternatively , I might have no directive at all .	0.015295794242019678
Neither outcome would be satisfactory .	52.09875239985661
Perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .	0.022689012091864674
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .	0.34566841778478113
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .	0.05101370870856103
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States .	5.874880092807601
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark .	0.13924576935406666
Accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .	0.1116476002374833
In return for this , however , we want early notification obligations to be discontinued , rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them , and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting .	0.019411836120832693
Consequently , I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .	0.31022077229850725
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission .	5.532564794252878
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution .	39.36031218772974
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card , as it were , for the reasons cited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution .	0.02710517978225101
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .	10.400878074734155
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .	11.44521775205811
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as EC .	0.025025815804422386
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law .	10.126490963789648
However , before the elections we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens .	0.00013379434104993917
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU .	7.761543511455738
They have now got to grips with "EU " .	19.629111524002436
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card " and not "EU service provision card " .	4.369076697208874
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes .	0.3176322066873605
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .	12.73459592718975
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed .	6.121161723635278
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism .	5.772849965386627
This directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that .	0.00014871403389015808
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market , creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed .	0.5292241794951638
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger .	5.831188536248154
We welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law .	0.0459802691473195
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council .	0.007633228895129788
Nevertheless , I have tabled an amendment .	0.004401377102649301
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security .	0.0008501185963805254
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit , since all that does is create legal insecurity .	0.34497982412417527
You rightly raise the concern , also expressed by Mr Wieland , at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire , but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit .	0.033325767975452926
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date , it must end on that date .	0.20824000819815233
Legal security requires this .	89.70022828565826
On the other hand , with regard to point d of Amendment No 10 , which refers to the first directive , you suggest that , for reasons of public security or public order regulations , a Member State may reject the validity of the card .	0.0018502742181867398
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .	6.904368636074949
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area , since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State , and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory .	0.18216999465185343
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity .	15.182584573316563
In the case of a non-Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22 , that possibility is contemplated , and is perfectly expressed , and I believe this provides greater legal security .	0.0014283626817674607
The discretional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10 , seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report .	0.04481379191263342
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .	0.22209862873537103
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks .	5.016258693841892
However , in the case of the United Kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable .	0.010959468218768325
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom .	7.852166612413164
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties , the United Kingdom retains its border controls .	0.07785826701738939
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State , thereby by-passing UK border controls .	0.03373937975168358
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process .	1.0953291337457445
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .	0.03202836419003335
Mr President , Commissioner , first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner .	0.0920197117952485
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services .	6.692190378283195
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises .	5.674887653770482
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential , for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts .	0.8741262370804009
Why do I think we need the directive so much ?	2.7681177482817647
Three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market .	0.06044077734378106
Therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions , I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible .	0.10810692382534585
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission .	4.70447620551314
Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations ?	1.4142130528295929
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?	0.008874728224619266
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms , namely the free movement of people and services , did not apply to them .	0.0004791414557218017
Indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided .	0.26487062916403065
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory .	8.981444791931718
I assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low .	0.023122500444055484
So , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation .	0.016232000678905442
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card .	6.868016637825995
It seems important , in this respect , to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner , namely within five days of a simple declaration ' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided ; and that , also to prevent misuse , this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended .	0.005172296700488345
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner .	10.845919179918063
Having also studied the amendments submitted , I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow .	0.6881228524055898
May I , to finish off , thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?	0.00074507045720648
I think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .	1.8462699687217152e-05
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .	0.09804293544013339
In the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made .	0.20708037573816798
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees , the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .	2.7968387146909397e-05
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established .	0.4560499847214988
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as I explained just now .	0.02490490437271687
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States .	0.03128765953132348
In terms of comitology , Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned .	0.02043540577011446
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned .	6.590185232778837
In this respect , the Commission supports Amendment No 22 , as I have already mentioned .	0.0011675828793002807
The other amendments are unacceptable .	47.187076942946206
Personally , I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card " which is proposed in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this .	0.05879577612422449
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .	0.21840065518808513
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .	6.7567638908994745
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States .	5.666555551486498
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on Amendment No 10 .	0.07120586265814319
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .	12.233300282179146
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .	13.277731456732969
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed " is concerned , the Commission will , as I have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged .	0.009159338747646512
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood ' s remark .	10.33778327412922
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States , and this includes the United Kingdom , are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders .	0.08807441604082808
This applies , as already stated , to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium , where it was recently of relevance .	0.0004679862677276689
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas , I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country .	0.6079529697944022
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries .	6.925149654318533
The question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .	0.0035344197791859844
In my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate .	0.41835104096236064
On behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .	0.30791456460371647
I will keep myself free in this connection .	15.562809385684423
Finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger .	4.15300258820382e-05
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .	0.001123832035071201
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m . Court of First Instance Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council ' s draft decision .	0.0007627276552134821
However , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency ' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the Community Courts .	0.128715715143283
For this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho .	0.16285972259466236
Mr President , the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales , and if , in the future , the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon .	0.0012310575909064223
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests .	1.1435302688110869
Behind these principles , Mr President , lies the justice system .	6.226075810031144e-05
However , justice delayed is justice denied , and we must reflect on this notion .	0.0017595467582636826
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information .	14.775838516964193
For this reason , the draft reform , which has been drawn up by the rapporteur , Vice-President Marinho , is to be welcomed .	5.792783377941155e-05
It is true that it is a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solutions because , at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.13415490891695214
We have to offer solutions which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .	0.008784178361317977
I would like to make two observations during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , given this Parliament ' s obligation , in accordance with the Treaty , to produce a very succinct report , which does not go into depth .	0.0017091594042120204
These are two of Vice-President Marinho ' s ideas and , I believe , they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .	0.020754350021295123
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more rfrendaire .	0.3285072521496627
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated .	8.469566833853353
At the moment , the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated .	0.1932311930551427
According to the Treaty , one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language .	0.7765036721339132
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points .	0.09102395528437028
The first concerns this Parliament .	37.713985788807534
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judges .	0.4150029902396952
Above all , we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations , in other words , its resources .	0.0005094695194994182
We wish to see its competences extended , especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options , certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens .	0.3741123049901299
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days .	12.535020252265017
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .	0.03118126158380837
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .	7.006157435808077
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice .	7.46577371911144
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT .	9.51259900751353
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy .	13.394042719373207
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age .	5.145501600283866
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe ' s system of justice .	6.625860723969749
Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy .	13.394040659710091
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court .	0.7223975875679312
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .	11.057989324132773
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union .	0.5549893652933222
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .	0.03838436825483276
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .	7.870913187157526
Otherwise we will all , as elected representatives , be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice .	0.03735478685883996
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .	0.019852412354105533
I also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service .	0.006046599921274997
In point of fact , I consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ' s visit to Luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a God-given fact as it were , that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve .	0.011672048851184636
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .	12.94390219754382
For example , I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance , if applicable , and making this a final competence , in those spheres where benches of the Court , which resemble courts , pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law .	0.003594310387017278
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission ' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level .	7.148809589064925
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions .	0.7697768929656185
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .	8.969019828922985
Where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance .	0.11418674683623783
In addition , we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs , not to mention groups , lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases , when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance .	0.07173036959128838
On a final note , I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law .	0.08411504355672422
As things stand , OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases .	0.1024130950498692
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court .	16.17808127941437
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance .	6.762279146913809
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on .	15.24390060798401
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work .	0.04657629391104051
The European Union is a system based on law .	24.145647228731836
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law .	16.07303750779654
Furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied .	0.00013105924484346096
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem .	5.574014497053714
However , as Mr Marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the IGC , In my own country , mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges .	0.001857122403729831
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system .	5.706470923142567
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union ' s disputes resolution procedures .	4.881643654266214
This has been compounded , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government .	0.07197020926155476
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible .	15.921784524466918
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable .	6.12557819735926
What is happening in France , Mr President , appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties .	0.06644275763127089
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings .	0.10575956694465684
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this .	5.627943294126209
Mr President , on behalf of Commission President , Mr Prodi , I would like to respond as follows .	5.7374450732583706e-05
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance .	6.495879304526674
The purport of this request is , on the one hand , to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance , such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and , on the other hand , to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance .	0.004306433696982094
May I add that , on behalf of the Commission , I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas .	0.11931056342874692
The unease is justified .	71.19511929969703
It has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .	0.09079598902943359
The Commission sympathises with these considerations .	29.14708288479702
In the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follows .	0.1296666739400385
As your Parliament is aware , the Commission is convinced that , without fundamental reform , the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines .	0.021724740177804087
Consequently , the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades .	1.145253859468383
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges , but at the moment , the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned .	0.1967109051372619
In other words , once this study is complete , the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible .	0.004386132638376311
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place at 11 a.m . tomorrow .	0.00032300722568818927
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000 ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS) .	0.011530801968972089
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes .	12.677380782574478
I propose that we start the debate immediately .	24.996912504183825
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives .	16.806399554730234
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges , in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .	0.22344790718827073
Mr President , this is an important and urgent matter , and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid .	0.006534185026480851
An urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .	0.04465244038536843
We have been asked for EUR 35 million .	20.863462221976036
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring , once the decision has been taken , that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible .	0.07569188331880698
We are talking about macrofinancial aid .	43.09950883274149
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .	4.935385751110537
This is not our opinion .	78.94508275836463
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region .	5.631959096078669
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state .	6.83757024751045
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying .	0.003802093830944903
The other parties are not paying .	31.78512171558763
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid .	8.037525531578364
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .	8.495322591645918
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors .	8.585233985918789
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors .	0.07926830572778559
From that point of view , the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest .	0.4115712843790823
Finally , we have three questions for the Commission in this regard .	0.04799825883023227
Firstly , we need the Commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute .	0.0009142026619534559
When we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying .	0.08812351217373893
Secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .	0.25883837359541023
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet , according to our information , no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date .	0.10579708795387861
This is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo .	0.08469365121934234
Finally , and this follows on from what I have just said , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made .	0.0032199441771217697
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments .	15.921785077771485
It is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suffice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid .	0.0014092572062460516
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment .	13.645426223240245
Mr President , if we are going to discuss Kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all .	0.0065072725050450385
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality , and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate .	0.693317871308243
As of 9 February , there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council , which will comprise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament .	0.004208682292255977
This is a positive move and we welcome it , but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare , for elections are planned for the autumn .	0.1686426932348235
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result .	6.306857560694538
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-vis UNMIK .	11.991584946848592
In other words , there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either .	0.4346345184002843
Of all people , it is the Albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them .	0.015564337699193676
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs , Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place .	0.014456791157423127
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about .	9.627700935624581
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors .	30.808233282439872
That is excellent news ! There too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources .	0.05586416221513047
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto .	0.04111407051596846
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law .	7.314032058764382
We have 130 judges and public prosecutors , who have now been sworn in , and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice , with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions .	0.0163942126724784
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country .	6.234465331755508
I believe that is a good thing I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way .	5.913242935062471
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything .	22.34560715658838
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner ' s outstanding bills .	0.46353812842996844
One could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet unfilled , that we are unable to fill .	0.004026857820062441
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it .	11.299883546100785
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanations .	0.0068584052690656835
In a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said .	0.1731652032485653
However , I would like to concentrate on two points .	0.02626947687643218
Firstly , I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo .	0.3528733234605036
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true , and that figures do not lie .	0.38501911156092683
Let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .	0.11527245474294333
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo , on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction .	0.6132285975672801
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments .	7.1362125529998535
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter , in any circumstances , the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin .	0.24695656754334733
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , according to which , when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary .	0.000803755520141444
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .	6.5973043146483175
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme , with the corresponding report , requested by Parliament , so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up , as we have been promised .	0.04562036904191132
Lastly , I would like to insist that , although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now , we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo , which is so badly needed .	0.007163691303746795
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today , more is the pity .	0.00021762254003762386
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million , and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need .	0.014054958903940958
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there .	6.690249875271163
However , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .	0.09984556350002417
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents .	6.369211726948486
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions .	11.432110459673574
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future .	8.96374218699057
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this .	12.931042167004087
However , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here .	0.03432737141633692
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims .	6.146207656462461
In other words , we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner ' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres .	0.34058139180166874
Secondly , even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into .	0.10126873231216973
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .	6.826479240456208
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe , in the interests of the persons affected .	0.30062871364757676
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms , that is to say , not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe , and with the aid delivered there .	0.03629833356158111
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence .	7.926167174839785
We have so many coordinators , who , in turn , are responsible to so many employers , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators .	0.00033121026605745165
Perhaps it would be better , however , if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations , were to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there .	0.02232107655996241
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this , but if the European Union is doing the most work out there , then it should also be given the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people .	0.01524678753426732
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground ! Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline , that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented , and there is a steady stream of new press conferences , this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe ! Accordingly , we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative , so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month .	0.3089400885571869
Rather , we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country , and I hope that in the process , you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months .	0.0461277964216529
Mr President , when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return , with respect for their own heritage and their own culture .	0.07978847533611035
If the Alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective .	0.07707190341738425
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be , particularly as regards security , crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level .	0.15648299215460762
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective , and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , are on the verge of despondency precisely because , since matters are improving , there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent .	0.039181886048785135
We must work to ensure that , in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally , the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords .	0.02381615522205736
It is true that economic aid is , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level .	0.029925953427625218
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we , the Members of the European Parliament , must fulfil our own obligations in this regard , while ensuring , of course , that we are not the only ones to do so .	0.0009166075322135336
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report .	6.802131898713094e-06
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .	8.879562013940744
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret .	14.29641605968868
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random .	0.017606690280435433
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and permissible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public , communal and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK .	0.010848550107639094
Commissioner , it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations , in particular Pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place .	0.047707352469549054
What is to be done with this money ?	2.795470243056807
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights .	12.725107876586183
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ?	3.6467593584308293
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit .	0.1674143994551718
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians .	0.001085745706339233
I was in fact shocked to read in the report , assuming this is true , how an Albanian doctor , who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties , ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life .	0.026277881598194573
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated .	14.949455630421415
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo .	5.700691287863176
There are , at the very least , rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again .	0.0016591586931001608
It is irrelevant , as far as I am concerned , as to whether it is Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo .	0.0005649186124128719
It is also irrelevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo .	0.004841286277924399
What is all-important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is , a Kosovo where people can live together .	0.00147305762426482
We need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough .	0.04249617823190679
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights .	0.34041414812851967
All of this needs to happen , and quickly too .	0.02512865382391299
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise .	7.060220345419539
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available .	0.4435958424736276
Only , now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use , notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary .	0.056671323912329596
.	1.0
(ES ) Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue .	0.0031799926289847514
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned .	6.4589045512022825
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate .	7.056503504294225
Firstly , although much progress has been made , and we could mention customs administration , bank administration or tax administration , it is true that we must continue to move forward .	0.0009589472877976794
However , in moving forward , what should we be financing ?	2.1717829505173584e-05
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement .	19.56215111253431
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds , for example , Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .	0.03665687783863019
In our view , however , in both respects , greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which , on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are .	0.0005686586944353639
We believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resources should be directed , would create more practical difficulties .	0.00048334312416762416
In short , we should put our faith in those parties who , in these areas , are better equipped than us to make certain decisions .	0.0007656607404128219
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .	0.5842956036974808
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ?	1.9907976903460083
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question .	16.34779530261817
For example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 .	2.974986560016005e-05
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally .	0.033640783471516715
The fundamental problem is that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group , but it is also true that they have no legal status .	0.02124936022101361
This is simply a political commitment .	39.76421674746541
That is the reason why , while accepting its spirit , we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources .	0.2309760577673742
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct .	0.037361558234130496
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature .	22.743963927622048
On this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction .	0.04704927914594274
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision , establishing this element of conditionality .	0.3619010412925137
With regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors .	1.0376770246916664
In other words , we should not establish conditionality , or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage .	0.0013101724379562447
In this way , we would have no problem in acting immediately .	0.03731862950736439
We would not create problems for the Kosovar people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing .	0.0076831120986502015
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dhrkop with regard to the multiannual programmes .	12.21716873466642
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual .	19.904955801362824
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account .	12.094492308379943
Lastly , I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us .	0.242755705436618
On the one hand , we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and , in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament ' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo .	0.0995918634744346
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published .	8.235922067538434
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .	0.2711132502962516
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .	7.461381215424894
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality , on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance .	0.0726464489046387
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and I hope that , with the final decision of the Council , we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties , so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see .	0.005978081647412044
Mr President , I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament , particularly the Committee on Budgets , and the Commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties .	0.0005656391934551857
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets .	0.002260980294500575
There was a clear agreement , good or bad I will not say , but there was a contract .	0.0065879675030113515
There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7 , i.e . on the idea of linking the mobilisation , the implementation , of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment .	0.014447696294760871
But , if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly , then this undertaking was only a tentative one .	0.00850136509113414
Commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .	0.004768629914157433
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets , yes or no ?	0.036000367653557186
Or are you going to drop this proviso , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ?	0.032522551557144404
No , Mr Bourlanges , I think it is a substantive problem .	0.00027475641853311005
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .	13.172232338857961
What I proposed to you , and what I still say , is that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council Decision , something like this : The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors .	0.009897278994610409
With this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed .	0.03815035587548719
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche .	9.730708182823564
I agree , absolutely .	1.0052220394402394e-05
We shall do so .	44.39922394549601

ALTENER The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000 ) by Mr Langen , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD ) Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council .	0.4020120129212476
The project has been long and problematic .	29.451056040090425
In future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources .	0.1973558251521972
Although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .	0.16365668469824177
One example is the use of peat .	38.36394324761689
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .	11.074549779763577
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non-fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .	0.009794591345055923
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as , for example , coal .	0.0053689236510330975
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union ' s dependence on imported energy .	7.1757752097966385
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next round of enlargement .	9.206838801726157
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries , whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy .	0.4518075838700122
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate .	18.312681970342126
We are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future .	15.702849251516406
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner .	0.3360323201638476
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come .	6.765953441478059
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy .	0.12721876189891507
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme .	0.023453472419965763
Firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report .	0.0001783596458662017
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee , Mr Provan .	0.09445706537618168
For as Mr Langen said just now , we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee .	0.16689831450279
However , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout .	0.27483029228496086
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community .	0.9714663587496444
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear .	15.76877631325304
However , we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed .	0.3341253121531962
For in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption .	0.031430938068564854
This is the European Union ' s declared aim .	33.591528920628264
That being the case , since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .	0.045120941430294055
In the first place , this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme .	0.16354716716079024
This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector , developing local and regional energy agencies , and establishing new networks for approving financial support , to name but a few examples .	0.02436366617810717
To my mind though , what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing , supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan .	0.10791515496267856
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy .	0.4755882780448655
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors .	13.99909830898941
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .	6.598162979537724
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion .	7.656056967003236
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources , and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions .	0.3636690565378552
In this respect , the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs .	0.004010371609349385
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter .	0.002283740501081834
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is , after all the difficult phases it has been through , at least satisfactory .	0.07445132979131767
Most of Parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive .	6.312363840258742
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .	10.567431207031664
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .	0.08837173223428141
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy .	0.0172339670983058
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States .	6.846024730794463
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .	7.220820417349843
However , in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market .	0.04641348462464564
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment .	13.328145345606753
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up .	8.302176132484457
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness .	8.917866226497472
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy .	6.548610382118549
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment .	7.025091870353897
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat ?	2.67371134169203
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .	11.559887415140748
However , it is important , at least in Finland , as a sustainably used , slowly renewable energy source .	2.3896287120811958e-05
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables .	19.788153650576838
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found , and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of .	0.03940609982225521
It is interesting for me , as a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation .	0.025706663663843162
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale .	7.9946553705549155
In contrast with that , I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies , which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion .	0.031521853787202014
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field , because they were the first ones to develop that area , gives one food for thought , I feel , and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies .	0.02080890689687571
One last word regarding the programme .	23.29840268757361
I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there .	7.100114358010051
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term .	0.6693218983718799
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work .	0.01098932019008887
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future .	4.428353121965898
For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises .	0.15486422396484079
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone .	10.155563869957273
In this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit .	0.09561498144045986
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables .	8.581137450748653
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend 125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector .	7.785444090230767
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives .	14.942240509001387
As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .	0.1884447768892243
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region .	0.6715981553594331
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector .	0.16135535762169867
In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies .	0.04004415269732225
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States .	7.61060516963598
Mr President , Mr Langen , ladies and gentlemen , as our rapporteur mentioned , we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme .	0.0007435828374084657
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million , whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million , a figure which the European Parliament supported .	0.011066625431011754
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million .	0.11088020154870014
We could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenged the authority of the European Parliament .	0.13456137199483148
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million .	2.9544270865851505
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal , personally , once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply , job creation and environmental protection , challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to .	0.110737221131921
In fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives .	0.022152419835141976
However , in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation , I personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme ' s content , to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as , following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , this sector become subject to codecision .	0.0030354297265105267
It is practically certain that , with the raft of proposed measures and actions , it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010 , doubling the current rate , as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available .	0.008366346822199753
This programme , together with the SAVE II programme , integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy , establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence .	0.004878379932859038
And , in conclusion , Mr President , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measures proposed , there are also legislative measures and , most especially , adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives .	3.02235694836483e-05
And I shall end , of course , by congratulating Mr Langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee .	0.00011547682529777245
.	1.0
(ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme .	0.029347639801023666
All of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme , which we will be discussing soon .	0.010620419849883263
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary .	0.15568407091383826
Obviously , there have been arguments , we had to go to conciliation , as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result was achieved , and there had to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figures were not excessive .	0.0015591205306306583
However , I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreements , is perhaps not perfect , but which , I believe , allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing .	6.462716194342905e-05
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen , on his work , to thank the speakers and , of course , to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result .	0.0004087688171539602
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council .	7.597660863560418
SAVE The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000 ) by Mrs Ahern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD) .	0.1814001616170242
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round , which is not always the case .	0.02685251392236857
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form .	5.062466843507793
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there .	7.224976159855999
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .	6.632091449906406
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget .	0.5211278441210772
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable .	5.323104553551612
During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures .	0.0009312336577643255
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency .	0.06614094548322551
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .	25.94936301322294
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer .	10.922902631532132
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount .	6.971081877553044
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under .	5.292582864515851
This was an important consideration for us .	20.337888895069643
I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real .	0.03612975044316479
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States .	5.518202695706877
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme .	14.743727598143929
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including Community actions , on energy saving .	0.022062895889095855
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region .	5.188646883695603
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard .	10.250994209436303
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .	9.806498057832423
It focuses on non-technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted .	0.061021488191577315
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings .	12.927447322472112
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business , saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical .	0.6302266281647395
It is something that we can all support .	31.878275858226942
I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving .	0.004724870874717991
We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports .	0.35278492595478456
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .	9.609329460096523
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change .	5.027421775252903
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .	9.094259176750118
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process .	10.712615437008706
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contributed , in collaboration with the other Members , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the Council had initially accepted .	0.0
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well , the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme , are basically symbolic budgets , since the burden is shouldered by the countries , the States of the Union , the regions or even , in some cases , the local authorities .	0.00021087163391077186
However , despite the fact that the volume is relatively small , it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action , which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments .	0.0446217478820004
This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources , greater safety in our energy supplies and , in the case of SAVE , to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set .	0.009944288458596327
Furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the SAVE programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the Altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole .	0.0
With regard to the parliamentary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of Parliament ' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications .	0.006856993447855667
I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved .	6.616447614026732
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament ' s prerogatives and competences .	0.04083424480374971
From the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it .	0.03354283924982642
I would like once again to thank all the speakers , and also , especially , the Vice-President , Mr Provan , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Ahern , and all the Members who have participated in this work .	0.0
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place at 11 a.m . tomorrow .	0.00032300722568818927
CULTURE 2000 The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000 ) by Mr Graa Moura , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000' ) (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD) .	0.19917688034168535
Madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate .	0.20069723987884425
Unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it .	0.3766839431357945
We have the feeling , and are in fact convinced , that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht .	0.04250452425676933
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture .	12.873430753399516
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts .	30.248923844687752
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course .	0.02210288683028142
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect .	0.5801156239677004
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision .	0.12936490210894702
What kind of horse-trading system is this ?	1.622388991374384
Certainly not a fair one ! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side , begging for a little more money for culture .	0.7070294658873981
It is downright scandalous what goes on ! It is an awful sort of horse-trading , based on unequal positions ! Nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .	0.12695276091609947
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .	11.515660207593738
We will support small and medium-sized events , not the large ones , and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access .	0.022522438109701434
I believe that the fact that Culture and , fittingly , Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner ' s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union .	0.010025064272433612
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit .	0.2982442684663339
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .	12.861456476291231
Madam President , I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that , during the conciliation procedure , I was personally a little disappointed with the Council .	0.005418124580498759
On the one hand , it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy " or other similar terms , even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty , and it defines "Culture 2000 " simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more .	0.0332593287575824
On the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament , which were minimal anyway .	0.01436325437090046
Incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council , since it was just one , the Netherlands , which was responsible for that intransigence .	0.00031560147752489695
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council .	6.005247541524425
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution .	9.083353634410287
However , Madam President , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union ' s most important programmes .	0.007291161950502994
By taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul , especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000 " are superb .	0.10510096514852121
In recent years , these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union .	0.15587077490454518
Lastly , I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur , Mr Graa Moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had .	5.230993148267351e-05
Congratulations ! Finally , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding , Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani , chairman of the Committee on Culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintained during the entire conciliation process .	0.0006228470419622757
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I would like to start by thanking Mr Graa Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme .	0.003794170121609859
It has been said before , and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions , that culture is , of course , extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea .	0.011079006234805268
It is also of great importance to citizens .	35.957514583946605
We should , above all , not lose sight of this .	1.3724887691152016e-05
The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential , but is also relying on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view .	0.04792787564463736
Today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .	0.053446369760900496
I would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above all , unwanted .	1.021639607982144e-05
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .	15.050509508946945
They are like a snake biting its own tail .	15.921787816748852
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget stays fixed .	0.03401742781046521
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage .	7.426925897013915
The result is 30% growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result .	0.09840294440365606
Of course , it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes .	0.4095669403486653
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot .	13.895647786557081
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas .	6.707616559715566
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .	0.25586619202758587
Fortunately , I am on the Committee on Regional Policy .	0.01678121063582728
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .	11.407722129933362
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happens to be cancelled , then surely this does not benefit the citizen .	0.13110846097527443
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect .	8.260199323276554
However , I do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that , in the next IGC , changes will be made to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary .	7.646384004987809e-05
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made : no more mega-projects , room for cultural networks , and sufficient attention to promoting reading , translating and translation companies .	0.0014369491690092249
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas .	22.269868418666594
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000 .	10.147159444842076
All that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .	0.10784052633496342
Madam President , all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture .	0.49944627578503703
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart .	7.939590153982854
Not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding ' s attitude - I think that , given the framework she was operating in , her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council .	0.10880011893028518
It is shameful ! That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union ! When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups , young musicians , pioneering activities in the arts , writers , to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign , something opposed , contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro , not just enlargement , nor geostrategic expedients , but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end .	0.025345119988216657
So long as we continue to have unanimity , so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue , we will never progress .	0.22690084871856064
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament ' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments .	5.8384498834387015
Madam President , I absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture , Mr Gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also , considerably difficult .	0.0030582174174324855
Of course , we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes , but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote , for example , the unique features of each cultural sector , even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors .	0.002673805574175327
We hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .	0.0012963261961440875
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people .	0.006882600570304407
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known .	0.6693313905324948
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture , one of the programme ' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action : the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this .	0.5939141690044354
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens : this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme , albeit with a scarcity of funds , can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal .	0.028398823815019337
Madam President , I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Graa Moura , who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri .	0.01679013697339745
Both of them have done a first-class job .	26.1586194146782
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .	0.027197780910035222
Why do I say that culture is important ?	2.564635138526256
Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity .	0.08352416994811322
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?	2.1904369338078045
But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .	0.0016817851794593652
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs ; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .	0.3136027716867287
Cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .	0.016249615676722506
However , it is not under threat from Europe .	0.01376054749197538
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven ' s sake .	3.165926484447379e-05
We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish saunas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat .	0.004560300194066403
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola , eating hamburgers , wearing baseball caps , watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time .	0.010291751324873005
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe ' s culture , but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can .	0.5025771141254634
That is what Culture 2000 is about .	23.07139846128975
So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review .	0.0025715726204704956
Are we doing enough ?	1.1486982650982247
And , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .	0.0010314539208258707
Madam President , I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Graa Moura , and Commissioner Reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .	0.00018118073598022985
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council .	5.27927587343014
The outcome can be considered reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council .	0.5457250572659873
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture .	9.19317704081154
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council .	5.079888423251189
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael programmes .	0.10615843398422033
When implementation of the programme begins , I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full .	0.38687025368489947
I believe and hope that , despite the assault on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status .	0.013383400611744426
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial .	5.07055856473229
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage , increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues .	0.5355779495056103
In this connection , I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon , the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries .	0.30849799728448724
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society .	6.690454772474908
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , somehow or other , today ' s agenda has come full circle .	2.4868502196742105e-06
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values , about tolerance , human dignity , human rights , a positive approach to the enlargement process , transparency and respect for each other .	0.00039443223678229435
Youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes .	0.049943209046034776
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union ' s goals .	7.430099003510972
Cultural activity creates identity .	79.91381944040448
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality , of an individual ' s own personality ; it builds relationships and communicates .	0.012753848087336683
We want a colourful Europe .	68.79477155589464
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity .	18.450125285152282
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences .	14.678160169679957
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget , the allocation of funds that is , into the different types of measure .	0.02194648775285819
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures , because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals ; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom .	0.12836364025159613
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .	12.94136602630596
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle , codecision procedure , and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen , and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness .	0.03186160119483081
Madam President , as we have heard , all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council .	0.0008640430693035142
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests .	0.8107922053704388
In this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order .	0.19523792699356596
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go-ahead .	0.0006458333604639275
The Council could not be moved , not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael finished .	0.007428537444085001
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .	12.64228436092755
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union ' s cultural policy activities once again .	8.234810953226473
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support .	6.574407097874946
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered .	0.41437220941062214
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro ! And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004 .	4.541773751352315
That is the same as a single , medium-sized , German opera house ' s expenditure over the same period , when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years ! There is a blatant discrepancy here ! And so we are going to have to be content , albeit very grudgingly , with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content .	0.03743246631912076
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out .	18.280369506895436
We can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day .	0.013276243463145623
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm ! Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .	0.04412238593106812
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance , and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions .	0.15297781014505427
What , may I ask , is the Council afraid of ?	1.1268633248744453e-05
Madam President , whoever has the honour , like myself , to chair the Committee on Culture , cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur , and Commissioner Reding , with whom he worked and who , even during the conciliation process , had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone .	0.0005441041408568682
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted , but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make .	0.6202575796501033
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we did not manage to adopt a review clause .	0.01028294689951866
However , Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted , and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years , and therefore to change the situation .	0.00914032050717018
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme , Culture 2000 , where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor .	0.19004084668870214
This is not rhetoric , but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission .	0.36027596204913864
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds , this evening ' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe , which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor ; culture then , and an institutional aspect , the basis for structuring a vast community , a prerequisite for economic growth , and not the complete opposite , as Europe , in its cultural habits , has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past .	0.0
Man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .	0.049210973379834155
Let us contemplate this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy .	0.27540432209958615
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graa Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry .	0.1619703788468301
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000 , having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate .	0.3303728681396164
Again , because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward , we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community .	0.10596038382461619
The fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this Parliament , the Commission and the Council is : What is Europe ?	1.7954417820707206e-05
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ?	1.9894882982386255
Europe is its people , its history and now its collectivity ; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe? ' - we answer it by saying , 'It is our art , it is our literature and it is our heritage. ' That is what Culture 2000 represents .	0.005623298022512641
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century , an identity which eschews the echoes of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty dans la realit .	0.00016048667071262159
And more than this - and this is more prosaic , Madam President , it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive , that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require .	0.058337814986504595
It promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded .	0.12994987760816082
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .	5.804451019910532
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .	0.001234371152483288
Following the conciliation stage , our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000 ' framework programme .	0.14867722475127154
We shall thus , in the course of the next five years , have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear , well-structured and , I am sure , successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector .	0.0003325686110652839
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending ' in this House , and I thank you for it .	0.16029525801616357
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process .	9.03363726238739
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , particularly to its rapporteur , Mr Graa Moura , its chairman , Mr Gargani , the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups , the Conciliation Committee and its chairman , Mr Imbeni .	0.0
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution .	15.921787957703955
Throughout the negotiations , they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time .	0.3125310994581735
We now have a framework programme , the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner .	0.042666018917912996
I would like to express my delight , with you , at this pleasing outcome .	0.0008940878333233528
In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions , these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said , that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment .	0.20928755860892637
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision , it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme , and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives .	0.297673809157846
If need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002 .	0.01507015937557308
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a formal commitment , not just words on paper .	0.0013083892583826823
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area , within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them .	0.06305598767058303
It is thanks , too , to Parliament ' s action , preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale .	0.015987781396683862
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen .	10.305918351861296
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for .	13.000211289548448
I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality .	7.244921162112942
I know that you , as Members of Parliament , in your own regions and countries , are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers , as one Member of Parliament said , go to make a vast multicoloured carpet .	0.0024093600790958455
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens , both in personal as well as in social and economic terms , but a right which it is our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union .	0.07846747270564444
This is what our European 'Culture 2000 ' programme offers .	18.58687768612084
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States .	7.678109171299403
Such policies are necessary , and I would like to see them developed further .	0.06726886441092209
It simply adds to them , complements them , building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries .	0.00519321021284997
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens ' participation in culture is a crucial task , one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it , and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union .	0.1683206863456485
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point .	12.572506857885552
If the Union is purely an economic union , then it is a stillborn project .	0.13084138285541289
However , if it is a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it becomes a living thing .	0.0005123755114380995
This is the foundation , ladies and gentlemen , which I intend to develop , and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration : firstly , providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme .	0.003247493136806442
Secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .	0.00030403676114394273
Thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .	0.01078663386157163
Fourthly , increasing audiences for culture , with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and , fifthly , protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe , and making them better known .	0.002026503861650623
The new programme will , I am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .	0.0029583343098029406
Madam President , I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for , once again , having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union .	0.002019741192162218
I am certain that it will not be disappointed , having given us its support , and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed , as things progress , of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens , which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union .	0.007643415849857515
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .	23.539723935524
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place at 11 a.m . tomorrow .	0.00032300722568818927
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m. ) End-of-life vehicles The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD) ] (Rapporteur : Mr Florenz ) Mr President , nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe .	0.01253031037458528
Even though they can no longer be driven , these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders ; and not just intra-Community borders , but also those outside the Union .	0.008713963345469587
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed .	7.424851070413308
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking .	8.674037542918624
We therefore have a number of amendments .	26.362748892424264
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective .	18.046229520177167
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive .	10.248688108684025
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area .	0.36459883208244237
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either .	10.580933110846921
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas .	10.207713482519978
This is my main concern in this matter .	13.617884596853006
In my opinion , the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe .	0.1776438130070239
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars .	9.564424733668824
This will involve , for example , disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil , removing break fluid , etc .	6.211498393347404e-05
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts .	16.24617981995766
What should we do with the shredded products ?	2.01786205837092
We should not overlook the fact that , although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery , they are by no means the only point .	0.023396426776125828
Do not forget that , in the case of cars , 80% of environmental impact comes through driving , 1% through recovery and 19% through construction .	0.0018415808663880121
Quotas are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .	0.00023066520757030124
Of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves .	0.19557664072204464
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .	7.798927859802238
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car , weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km , to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg .	0.00258678726009825
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation .	0.20347694838614463
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which , if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol , is the important factor .	0.03869578643122193
We therefore consider that , in future , vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas .	0.02106825602305042
It should not be for each Member State , but for you and your staff , Commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles ) should receive preferential treatment .	0.012089555045794103
We think they should .	52.81513246401594
May I say something about costs .	41.22020594029987
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer .	0.39914899011892213
However , this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling .	0.33410323911207196
I can only warn you against consenting to this .	13.349933874237362
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .	5.7350199179631165
The money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder .	0.010188165860059883
This too is a particular desire of my group .	12.97499451889239
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage , namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted .	0.4033867944547146
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions , which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly .	0.22823564283455247
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer .	8.74577205028984
As for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one ! A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term .	0.27159330657380193
This means that we need a pressure instrument .	34.457242583240685
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives .	10.982591297862523
There are a number of sound amendments .	40.4297566609822
This Parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it ! Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive .	0.402050859930818
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House .	5.979964384599893
I ask for your support .	44.531483770255
Mr President , I almost feel like saying , "Phew " , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work , and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur , Mr Florenz .	0.0018285573536945474
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which , today , can only be removed at local authority expense , i.e . the taxpayers ' expense .	0.011705021330340494
The principle of 'polluter pays ' is not being applied .	13.616935279268889
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation , in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles .	0.45323822627824867
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .	10.08986002621543
It has not , however , been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle .	0.03098298849959601
On the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a ) materials that are easier to recycle and (b ) to set up recycling industries .	0.8084520169850441
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling , reuse and incineration , as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions .	0.14572180861354234
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives , including the one on auto-oil , which we voted on a few years ago .	0.05486488388820115
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on having the wisdom , in order to make things perfectly clear , to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage .	0.01038686294164832
In conclusion , let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests , lakes and gardens .	0.12395402764799526
Once again , the principle of 'polluter pays ' is not being applied .	0.010985221253809001
The taxpayer is still footing the bill .	23.375331796541634
Mr President , Commissioner , reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks , one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe .	0.007283687240865402
Neither is correct .	145.45691353081207
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive .	14.841867293405501
It means ecological progress for Europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion .	0.23213906365696096
All the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .	0.07425767602936317
In the grand scheme of the directive , it is perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one .	0.005640225390619124
It concerns the issue of recycling costs .	44.002372409162874
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs .	4.440834643512146
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question ! So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?	2.6368721816625746
For us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars .	0.36458339577029986
And what about vehicles which are already on the road ?	1.904354605793191
Let us look at an example .	27.301692270192845
Rover in Great Britain , if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars , would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs , whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts , as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it .	0.015280772086434217
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe .	0.2041115583936638
Consequently , for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs .	0.5837066361045744
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds .	5.26494880631554
However , I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe , so that these jobs can be secured in the future .	0.06058180556862267
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements , as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions , but I believe that they should be the same for everyone ! Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive .	0.008608270196997996
Firstly , because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives .	0.016882976561787253
Secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .	0.00012992355853441617
Thirdly , because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals .	0.12250568456153921
This is also an important point .	33.359409715558705
The directive affords a European framework , also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these .	0.35269628554089033
So , first of all , we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level .	0.0023035074986554127
This will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of .	0.015916890877385383
Secondly , we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position .	0.0986634659543213
As from 2006 , therefore , all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners .	0.004820639227250275
Needless to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .	0.10886377902032866
Is this too much of a burden ?	1.5986759650101066
There is , however , one thing we should not overlook .	4.636876541134702e-05
The directive applies to complete cars , that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing .	0.141476201251552
According to the experts , few of these complete cars are of no value .	0.07416577997661379
After all , recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making .	0.07479835191886947
Quite the reverse , in fact .	0.0003939063147353638
At present , there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them , and a decent one at that .	0.0050775302818297716
This directive encourages the whole of this sector .	18.88445328621694
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses .	14.883985796645508
Since , in this case , transport costs are high , a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised , because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity .	0.009450271126868776
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles , and I think we ought to add this provision to it .	0.5499243063188921
I think , therefore , that vintage cars ought to be exempt .	8.176911112306051e-05
Also , it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer .	0.17966049526019137
That is a basic principle which we must uphold .	28.434127574651416
As manufacturers are responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase .	0.3556978482750097
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulated in the common position .	0.20148773458453162
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things .	10.0039551600022
I think we need to retain it .	48.67715927011101
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence .	10.486603063673968
After all , we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about , and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position .	0.035880612250390576
In my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons .	0.014477761419714956
I would ask you to support this common position .	17.207680310963784
Our group will , at any rate , do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including , for example , the way in which the costs are to be distributed .	0.010004889091962559
Mr President , we need to take an important decision today .	0.006979809773219889
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer ' s liability , that is to say that cars , once they have reached the end of their lives , are the responsibility of the car manufacturer ?	0.006824493118955629
No , according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No . 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50 .	0.0008857624121846256
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work .	6.378998497348314
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment .	6.882704607305755
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45 .	0.07095836166686745
The common position stipulates 2006 .	70.61012462425516
According to the group of the Greens , this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations .	0.24866788237993506
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists .	7.552717490128967
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars , they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply .	0.5677114090133742
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic .	5.809546980896873
This is ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .	0.011541875685193
For twenty years , the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener .	0.10764993073363822
Today , this green position is being threatened under pressure from , in particular , the German and French car industries .	0.00025395227216600387
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45 .	12.75975492391873
We , the Green Group , by and large support the common position .	0.0003656261402256738
Mr President , the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances .	0.22441693506154398
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area .	4.198536228170236
With this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this presupposes that the Council ' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament ' s reading of it .	0.08181169023722809
If they were adopted , many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive .	0.11530175662445387
This applies , above all , to amendments from the Group of the European People ' s Party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendments from Mr Lange , as I see it .	0.00010647536395651926
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in Germany , went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted .	0.04595457917657753
For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .	0.007298978177717209
The polluter should pay .	50.88697271140443
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicles .	0.018196231353733387
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too .	24.406803057700063
Where this aspect is concerned , we cannot accept any weakening of the Council ' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force .	0.4106476641784978
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years , and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead .	0.5976637339607658
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations .	10.948500210818008
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament ' s credibility on environmental issues .	0.08835700164872914
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries , for example my own country , Sweden .	0.23195188752563772
I was myself a car worker before I was elected .	11.932733947982442
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars .	8.176868370901905
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry .	12.725065738929443
These would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms .	0.00013703411055640156
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union .	7.130946623876405
Mr President , I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe .	0.010150507502799031
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .	8.838804654856942
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .	15.933226187612624
Each year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union .	0.015014940727164083
This in itself generates a large amount of waste .	14.03650448878535
Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars .	0.38658878813181835
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union .	4.1376213684481
From an Irish perspective , I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles .	0.8939405064089696
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis .	4.501384410750355
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years .	0.49240015705462936
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information .	7.768970258770169
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year .	6.821108120803177
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations .	6.332013077588165
Mr President , the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe .	0.05554510417054638
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials , a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation .	0.48371403081658826
In this regard , we are certainly on the right track , but as some Members have already stressed , the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a shared responsibility .	0.010763416196186011
I would like to say that in Italy , considerable headway has been made in this sector ; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market , but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high , and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market .	0.05121132830323047
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .	15.380286866201189
In Italy , we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars , but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy .	0.15263727617709236
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist , adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and , all things considered , find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members , who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible .	0.035637123621775076
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this ; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that is , to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements .	0.007851602159761757
Mr President , this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life .	0.30527151460411706
To that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity .	0.01329766516445444
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ?	1.8340066158615043
Who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?	6.173542633131443e-05
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ?	1.9152039967879653
The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .	0.0013969360664540624
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union .	4.802864249764016
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .	6.657521006066238
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere .	0.02815600578023839
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .	0.30929817054649933
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure .	0.00019062825926021102
Retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law .	0.09896444743566725
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .	0.3215931734327783
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this .	10.545245188341772
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry .	0.6087831871792226
Mr President , once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive , and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague , Bernd Lange .	0.004362037725867182
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives .	6.645328942639469
The Council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all , or a significant part , of the costs of recovery and recycling .	0.02912953291411027
But , as Mr Lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers .	0.003730768949928791
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry , I can tell you that it is not possible , retroactively , to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road , i.e . effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe .	0.006893102061598027
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs .	4.894465655897432
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market .	8.427934563935583
Of course , we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby .	0.03912899327471579
We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive .	6.595721695925506
This is why , I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange .	0.10237172249211986
These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints , since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States , and some of them work perfectly well , will be able to continue to operate .	0.15409837763407921
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union , but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector .	0.010872525092038225
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must , of course , be exempt from the scope of this directive .	0.005571481476950919
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage .	17.789933481210223
I think we would all agree on that .	25.81789082211165
Having said that , one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12 , i.e . the date on which the directive will come into force .	0.000644975624942839
Parliament ' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive ' s entry into force , for new vehicles , is not terribly realistic .	0.021478767091586234
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling .	6.876716221798483
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road .	7.037349692972383
This would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses .	0.003586758625374174
Like my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , I feel , offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection .	0.003641546937716241
Mr President , the European Parliament is today facing an important decision .	0.007318372971628649
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or , as the amendments of Florenz , Lange and others cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry ?	0.008798921569089202
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake .	9.85234658427865
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection ! The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious : to sabotage the directive ! The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation .	1.4647433512883796
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more .	4.119563838440201
This is totally unacceptable .	100.6850726198039
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today ! The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive .	4.708732506574185
Do not continue in this vein ! The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry .	4.344491543038435
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers ! Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry ! Mr President , this directive has been under discussion since 1997 .	0.73730610345928
It is high time that we reached an agreement .	12.744406918753402
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague , Mr Sjstedt and the representative of the Greens , Mr de Roo , I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me , and I will highlight just two issues .	0.006374179297742896
Firstly , and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the idea , which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste , that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution .	0.0022192586482015736
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contains PVC .	0.011502260870303583
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .	22.63750947289616
The other question is who should bear the cost .	12.24266612801987
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay , and this proposal expresses that idea very well .	0.19595143258841838
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006 , as some of the amendments propose .	0.8442173760522467
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .	10.20142419820361
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials .	7.796639291426832
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines .	20.907779267108747
Lastly , Mr President , I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised , can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area , preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies .	0.0022198078503511375
Mr President , today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities .	0.016482737689255084
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year .	10.51749421322745
In some of our Member States , voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches , canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks , inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken .	0.027406648755517876
I come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries .	0.007634091987616686
I can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation .	11.909840918634764
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles .	5.642089905233968
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise .	10.340924844354761
That is why , today , we must be understanding alchemists , concerned for our environment .	3.674471936647661e-05
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not .	6.847522103282547
As far as I am concerned , at least , the principle of 'polluter pays ' must be applied .	0.002062955196145841
The car industry , increasingly more respectful of the environment , has , I am sure , anticipated this kind of increasing awareness .	5.0777843625095886e-05
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities .	30.21429500303109
It is the Member States , however , who will have to implement this directive , and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions , the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland .	0.007419007620334427
I am opposed to making the car owners liable .	17.888118894001753
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter , pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement .	0.6955018968304724
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer .	5.638595085931843
How , furthermore , can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe .	0.006126242210991833
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium ?	1.9609429596871202
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle ?	1.691725215835277
Let us beware , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .	0.007941989929397271
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today , but to continue on our present course , advocating sustainable development .	0.02422539726611211
Mr President , most of the time , the European Parliament , spearheaded by environment committees , does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view .	0.00165839467563619
Now , a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament .	0.4489201959356887
Every year , we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances .	0.027010078068677033
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials .	20.945707059553957
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals , as well as of other dangerous substances and materials .	0.17875561438992357
In addition , car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use .	0.11561876024090255
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately .	9.381939164995561
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council .	5.676462964892282
These days , the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable .	0.010551277859894247
This means that we move away from shredding .	36.67294854474316
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and , in the Netherlands , a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved .	0.008708339552211636
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost .	5.3363050728526495
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars .	11.089471951896028
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system .	10.12217746379686
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation .	11.842266765668658
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied , it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably .	0.39074404904929705
Finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .	0.05582728157463488
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .	0.07784346660625066
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled ?	2.582729998148125
If we are , then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved .	0.24078145390688876
Mr President , I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem .	0.003996829672770607
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry .	6.685134208083082
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise .	0.020377852331951378
That was not easy .	63.4276518525715
Overall , I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position .	0.1950478767246533
I would like to comment on two things .	27.501778959372075
Firstly , vintage cars and motorbikes .	0.008676445031764325
These should indeed be excluded from the directive .	16.4178087343132
Secondly , the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars .	0.13477893809233546
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .	11.805800146664716
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .	6.068374490069554
In my opinion , there is too much initial hesitation .	0.018161846546216227
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path .	11.270228398872403
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on .	8.481600101486235
These costs are not very high .	33.437568356027896
In the Member State where I come from , you are talking about 150 Guilders per car .	0.12080678575894847
If you charge this from day one , you can process the old cars straight away .	0.09843735264804487
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards , which used to be a common feature in our Member States , would then disappear .	0.03282265103826166
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .	10.267929126997153
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible .	6.128462911434046
This is positive because , in that way , the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately , and this will benefit us all .	0.005497415109662503
Mr President , the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars .	0.3711392844906798
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers ' liability .	7.3309466923919215
If we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .	0.3087635652281128
The common position , which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council , which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament ' s Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , complies fully with the environmental requirements .	0.0059913427853644325
I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers ' liability .	0.10686458182492317
If these amendments are adopted , I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues .	0.19532850345862166
So far , we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now , if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted , we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe .	0.01091419283317653
What is more , if we reduce manufacturers ' liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas , for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment .	0.01309961923704102
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability .	5.105098572750179
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .	19.4870749551891
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled .	0.0017728705647785678
Now who should pay the costs ?	1.919453354853831
Whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .	0.07407832363626402
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars .	5.107295901795296
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals .	5.772188039121659
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers ! If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .	4.953020341526749
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate is not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .	9.060919565691134e-05
It has become eminently political .	57.521684928932
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate .	14.94945533892063
Today , if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers , we should be doing ourselves dishonour .	0.02611749768602634
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles , as Amendment No 38 stipulates , even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer , Parliament would , for the first time , not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe , it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies .	0.005893459752409716
We cannot accept this .	64.85506334233321
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas .	8.535786014671732
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position , whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough .	0.6646081531500488
The free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .	0.026629522607030828
Thus , for the consumer , for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling , the Council ' s common position definitely must not be amended .	0.004417905379020803
It is , as it stands , perfectly acceptable .	3.6209700438655148e-06
Mr President , like so many others here today , I believe this is a good measure .	0.001085938640330544
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .	17.867833061359054
Most of the technical issues have been resolved .	17.6676123374313
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .	8.719678211123776
We have arrived at the final question .	29.451065134854232
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament .	4.976501103139269
That is quite simply : Who pays ?	0.0014779389774192393
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said .	0.447135832405453
In fact perhaps as little , the lawyers tell us , as 20% or one-fifth of the cost .	0.0038479057796712486
That is not unreasonable .	133.7700688743925
If you look at the UK consumer for example , who buys a Rover , as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars , over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe , why should they pay ?	0.016788522133134406
They have paid already .	89.7002407191097
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers , pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from ?	0.18276015643634774
I cannot accept that .	46.733825593002415
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .	9.380885605730063
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it .	15.445062386283253
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .	14.408443791700707
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .	10.667547506141402
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government .	13.872625078791705
The common position is a reasonable compromise .	31.807989134999293
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road .	4.4656565371879475
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments .	6.9517866471283325
Mr President , there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars , although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy .	0.08419739639076351
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter .	10.599310521473862
Firstly , Herr Trittin , the Environment Minister , was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet , then Chancellor Schrder blundered in like a bull in a china shop , having no expert knowledge of this process .	0.0007825517958368467
Mind you , even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved .	0.12161106333236608
There are certain weaknesses , the greatest of which , in my opinion , is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses ; after all , the car industry is more than just large companies .	0.0005396294063357172
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises .	6.364084593370691
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .	8.082410550784235
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs .	0.6403018242719928
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint .	14.791620057201513
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position , I really must object , because quite simply , it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by means of rigid , high recycling quotas ! Consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars .	0.010816824157484767
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .	17.13581194995268
However , the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these .	0.5636298560836817
Mr President , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position .	0.029523519673698633
In contrast to what the previous speaker said , I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values .	0.4766843363352806
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs , we will be creating a loophole : we will not have created a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order .	0.026129080960569387
That is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .	0.0025615817746336487
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem , taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future .	0.5575485793786292
Mr President , there are two issues of principle in the Council ' s draft directive .	0.03437725523071067
The first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles .	8.513774809172688
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade .	15.172912535294389
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles .	7.508793649101985
I believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned , the EU ' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly .	0.03501513630548535
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears , for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts .	0.7662267677665676
Yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles .	0.1777622721799633
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy .	6.6055223080120085
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up .	10.534171805547857
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .	0.13599809332157992
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development .	4.987046906206717
The second principle in the Council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .	9.364054656023006
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product .	6.127692915811137
To do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively .	13.813541600923072
Over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .	0.10914618763648606
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars .	10.444447883952861
Some may be better than others , and some worse .	0.025772737733268825
In anticipation of this EU directive ' s being implemented , EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied .	0.8242022536302444
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .	8.869492238615894
Mr President , everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question .	0.05559298777467918
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement , and puts the whole directive at risk .	0.33930797614175473
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument .	6.740956769562677
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not excessive : recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car .	0.08371688098328303
Moreover , the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006 , when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market .	0.03278327054524859
As for the remaining vehicles , we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs , as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange , the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries , and we should therefore support them .	0.02344260333395669
Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive .	0.001988919019269218
First of all , as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle .	0.008559491137008544
Secondly , it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .	0.21644953068490785
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .	6.815762004080421
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate .	0.24291131571149066
It is like so much European legislation .	21.112627076130472
It is far too prescriptive .	65.56619625480381
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling .	14.03650522971005
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them .	0.0428117945006852
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars .	6.652165879415244
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .	6.931726633597281
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts .	0.40759431783247474
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach .	43.434263546109825
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery .	6.945653820365426
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead " car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process .	3.8730417487499795
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive , it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally , and are certainly very damaging economically .	0.26328746116199836
Mr President , the common position is sound , but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles .	0.0067818304983704525
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .	6.305304150520242
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45 , in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer , for new cars at any rate .	0.08712930362314457
Consequently , consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production .	0.1300021340406019
For the cars currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands .	0.03439700514884147
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end-of-life vehicles .	0.17668275989361956
This is a big problem in my opinion .	22.098611706121634
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market .	0.5355580120713197
They would then determine their own prices .	25.24676070713927
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic .	9.03472745746945
The European consumer organisation , which has asked us to support the common position on this point , is to my mind letting the consumer down .	0.020855307367765585
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers ' clutches is the cost of transport .	7.14200805634476
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies , this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances .	0.18070741524109285
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either .	9.9014345631499
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45 .	13.39402165160878
Mr President , Commissioner , I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate .	0.00862110625241842
If you travel to the Netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free .	0.20791688148844567
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of , that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials , that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled .	0.1773242983855977
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .	11.121622536160416
Should this be condemned ecologically , Frau Breyer ?	0.007331070170294685
I do not think so .	79.42790936207723
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around , the manufacturer , has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ecology ; it is a simple question of competition ! The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer , say , EUR 2 million .	0.0025277921621884403
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe , I am in favour of not making competition unequal but , in terms of environmental protection , I want freedom from costs for the last owner , to be financed by a special fund , and manufacturer responsibility for new cars , which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars ! (Applause from the PSE Group ) Mr President , the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages , mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use , the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials , etc .	0.0037695461040376265
I think we have tabled a sound proposal .	32.678739461719026
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer , the vendor , or whoever , should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost .	0.0019558067004499676
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems .	7.325257065889224
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved .	18.29653180670826
These include car manufacturers , second-hand car dealers , the federation of the car industry , the metal processing firms , shredding firms and the government .	0.0002942254167216668
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis .	10.783790406204128
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars - did not have any problem with that .	7.647909868599106
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost .	11.45128529353898
In connection with this , we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well .	0.89812017654561
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses , because they managed to recycle certain materials , even materials which are not yet included in the directive .	0.025048223676540547
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain .	6.386728003667364
I am in favour of collection free of charge .	20.44633223406144
It worked for us .	57.77929720168273
Why would it not work elsewhere ?	1.5746093915494488
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented .	0.0029664147748134184
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .	6.726418660416421
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive .	8.117851344003352
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate .	7.028292119850747
First of all , I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned .	0.18139225072989765
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union , resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste .	0.46878762723651535
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars , and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open .	0.44489762257672366
Moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .	0.04879782811024916
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substances .	0.002810551903274239
This is something you already know , but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening .	0.31361918005120987
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe .	8.964379709569998
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .	0.4172100625708387
The present directive has three aims .	34.66192156484544
First of all , we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars .	0.1267657159299715
Secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable .	0.09678910125659404
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life-cycle .	9.295539298653516
Instead , we should avoid creating so much waste .	0.01936525314160962
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product .	7.50071514746906
Thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive .	0.10208336844840069
These are the three most important aims of the directive .	12.39348081212739
This is , of course , because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled .	0.004461748507659036
It is , above all , the manufacturer ' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car ' s life-cycle .	0.008465233953309718
Two important questions have arisen in this regard .	13.691707858575183
Yes , there are in fact more than two questions , but I want to mention just two of the most important .	0.008693028316343228
First of all : who should pay ?	0.00010854007222758752
And secondly : are we reducing the European car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?	0.016090357294716414
The first question , then , is about who should pay .	0.00011060260379355542
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU ' s treaty concerning the manufacturer ' s liability .	5.289184236537424
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers .	10.641827585894601
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .	6.911268289296019
Do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ?	0.0011389948522625467
No . Clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater .	0.002009516568678338
Moreover , the cost will have to be borne in the future .	0.04598800876169118
The cost will not therefore disappear , but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed .	0.30977500578073924
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?	1.91634041702254
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it ?	2.5976807546825635
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these ?	2.1372412874607285
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry ?	2.5051337732334478
No , of course not .	0.0012304837049792081
It is quite the opposite .	50.175289313468966
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future ?	2.3900735077442827
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars ?	2.5008447371472915
Naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment .	0.003045006319858528
It is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .	0.001090770387881644
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste , recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars .	1.2040156726607614
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are , in fact , a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility .	0.08021063477888489
The cost is not insurmountable ; nor is the task an impossible one .	0.06723384520131384
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described , I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload .	0.7282704753241314
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems .	7.6560565460473065
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe .	9.222181898257205
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry .	9.787953309677311
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars .	6.782793973550135
We must do this for the sake of the environment .	11.091974389842019
The costs will not disappear .	52.09875672222836
Nor will the waste disappear .	52.0987603706291
But , otherwise , we must all of us , as taxpayers or citizens , foot the bill .	6.975998624462304e-06
What is more , the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action .	0.07408153277122827
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction .	22.907679085946633
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation .	13.018629250038291
If we assume that , on average , a car has a life of eleven years , do Members , indeed does anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem ?	0.00022474944476732301
Do you think that , when we legislate about chemicals , we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future ?	0.07900166193500295
Clearly , we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars .	0.24755929029836904
It is still not an insurmountable problem .	31.808857163292966
We can deal with it .	46.39947522680505
We already have an infrastructure .	63.50904200638734
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars .	14.257246432029472
I naturally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one .	17.34906791243335
If I have not already done so , I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .	0.07405344708590748
In fact , it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer ' s liability .	0.04808123331566485
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment .	9.383820226669844
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters .	12.22225212132618
As I have said , we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues .	0.08939902164410128
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999 , the Commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council .	0.27166042248847255
However , we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency .	0.07563033930141264
Now , we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully .	0.08503535074313541
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled .	13.875756845885983
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety .	17.455446838929337
Three amendments can be partially approved , and one can be approved in principle .	0.061040198451419864
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission ' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed .	5.914652820379474
This applies to Amendment No 5 , excluding section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; 10 and 12 , section 3 ; 15 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 and 25 .	0.0
These amendments can all be approved .	29.637672989132223
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new ; the Commission can approve these .	0.050720370574511106
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes .	13.551062621426073
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal ' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position .	5.150082701829083
They cannot therefore be approved .	37.234290168730105
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe .	7.6015206903817765
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today .	10.881992838329408
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question .	7.610566114435576
These concern , for example , the phasing-out of heavy metals , manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling .	0.00010268666528158126
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis .	23.940434274755237
Amendments Nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals .	7.832736308402234e-08
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force .	7.529148247795358
Amendments Nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions .	1.3938852106527073e-05
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly .	11.192272306077275
Amendments Nos 4 , 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling .	0.2103177673860968
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view .	5.838120422230081
Amendments Nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer ' s liability .	1.0918698057958416e-06
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile .	21.817991675505574
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without , at the same time , creating tensions .	0.005510674621660534
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used , so creating uncertainty about the Commission ' s attitude to the issue .	0.4923295439353084
I want to emphasise that , as early as 1997 , the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position .	0.04226671180142242
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers .	24.901586502721177
Far from it .	145.45691353081207
Amendments Nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives .	0.0004276495103287821
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .	7.310273846616118
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise .	9.584620462847882
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now , because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished " cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .	0.0029662503225676455
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive .	7.555315593473303
So , whatever has been stated in this regard , vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive .	0.007998781467755841
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .	8.559334254083886
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission ' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components .	9.08830818382134
This is not covered by the directive .	29.069800466792643
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council .	6.882927078862394
Amendments Nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles .	0.11218258765099237
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , tyres and glass .	0.2791854119099715
Finally , the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity ; nor Amendment No 19 , which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .	0.0079585171159862
Furthermore , Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability .	0.16071523743252528
Thank you very much , Commissioner .	0.0010244419272122105
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
We shall now proceed to the vote .	13.996679256024068
Vote Madam President , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the French version .	0.008498345481137651
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently .	7.681875153657845
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4 .	9.07172421072879
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations .	12.591680620298105
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques ' .	10.72581950103194
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct .	9.268052713088826
It should not be in the amendment .	42.55868046138737
And , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .	5.129649086345641e-05
Madame McNally , in general , I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations .	0.003275502422174864
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution .	9.042784571235567

We consider the English version to be the original text .	18.631338197466565
To give you an example , in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions , the equivalents of the English words : "in so far as " have been omitted .	0.010910430138137323
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version .	9.885371711735838
Thank you , Mr van Velzen .	0.00041102434036368354
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now .	9.707292674987322
I am very concerned about these translation problems which , unfortunately , we seem to be having increasingly , and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed .	0.009391626449155888
In any case , the authoritative version is always , of course , the original language version .	4.596409730424061e-05
Madam President , the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment .	0.005619984309219467
I shall read it in English , which is the original language of the resolution .	0.04352827623842541
"Condemns Mr Haider for his insults towards certain EU Member States and their leaders in the last few days in statements , which Foreign Minister Schssel has failed to condemn. " (More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet ) (Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE McNally Report (A5-0082/1999 ) - (FR ) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science ' .	0.6695746950566348
In this document , the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe .	0.23311062703145513
This objective deserves our total support .	29.147080390312304
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union , after agriculture and the Structural Funds .	0.19848820573542747
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States .	3.88559072345631
Relatively few women , however , are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies .	0.005916033650605553
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented .	24.337915110537114
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission .	11.265286556257882
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which is quite obviously something I approve of .	0.06746965152247929
The goal for the years to come is to increase women ' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants , in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .	0.7983711041598601
In order to do so , it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States , to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science ' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women ' s participation in research activities .	0.1747214033427592
Furthermore , like the rapporteur , I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields .	0.14433960714311814
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles .	8.261705120685333
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy .	6.401256746007873
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .	4.841085815249185
We must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other European Union policies , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market .	0.07201967124886659
In its communication "Women and Science " , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe .	0.3118704017855599
This is very good , and we are pleased to see it .	0.039545321405625077
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union .	5.531274623868382
We know that we can change this situation , in which women are underrepresented in the science sector , only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and , when they have obtained their degrees , by means of positive measures at the professional level .	0.025984078833208243
Having said this , some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe .	0.910303172053003
This is patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .	0.07925117363976715
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .	7.112147282033396
To set my fellow Members ' minds at ease and to reassure them , I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission , in its communication , undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women ' s participation in Community research programmes , which is , after all , a praiseworthy goal .	0.002420163737410154
And why should we not note that the Commission ' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women ' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes ?	3.5485871387399923
It is not a quota ! It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission , insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States .	0.387990689746998
The latter would be well advised , however , to follow the good example of the Commission , for once , and make the same efforts in their own research programmes .	0.0003162628503401788
People must realise this ! I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally ' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women ' s participation in professions in research and science , met with a fairly wide consensus .	0.9226452664104651
On this subject , any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable , and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women : to enjoy equal access to scientific study , to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence , and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly , enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career .	0.018323941894792455
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must , as far as we are concerned , necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity , which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject .	0.008524913328443635
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values , which truly respect gender differences , not on some postulated sexual equality , which has its own intrinsic contradictions .	0.006171430207699198
In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy , based on the use of quotas , contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by , and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally ' s report , namely women ' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit .	0.08642691512258124
By having the opportunity to show their true merit , by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women , and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege , women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish .	0.11997820400886147
In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour .	11.05602130358988
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms , and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part , I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally ' s report .	0.28444337672208175
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000 ) Madam President , today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles .	0.35169079673269776
I have rejected the entire directive , not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House .	0.42454280378996573
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable .	6.912883183747012
Here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies .	0.006364507563363342
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment .	9.059729549604189
I consider that this is a serious defect and that , in principle , it does not befit our legal system .	0.004788137159930695
In my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .	0.025714669789061416
Madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report .	0.008261878763042189
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down , the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups ) have not , thank God , succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility .	0.020075305611717748
Unfortunately , there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i.e . through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years .	0.005540451963198942
We know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made .	0.055451154042458435
Here , unfortunately , the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry .	0.0009582938361297593
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz , Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles .	0.679144382192647
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed , that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority , by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries .	0.3316493561242585
Madam President , although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars , I agree with my colleague , Mr Florenz , that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included .	0.0017469555451847265
These splendid cars do not constitute waste .	25.24675839886583
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments .	11.021506668824362
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s .	4.38302879749315
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .	10.279143998018492
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either , of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone .	0.18580598879021168
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance .	16.227247423845263
- (SV ) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing , to say the least .	0.08856040420733809
Before the vote at the plenary sitting , new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee .	0.2737711655390363
In the divided situation which has now arisen , we therefore consider that the Council ' s wordings are the best .	0.22408791382215446
We need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .	0.10218979129978763
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .	10.096926053876444
It is therefore important that the manufacturer ' s liability should be clear .	13.11234732630208
This should not in any way be jeopardised .	27.82051328854079
Today , Parliament is examining , for the last time , this text on 'end-of-life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them : their destruction , a commendable intention with regard to our environment .	0.00038328408262347887
There are , however , two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text .	0.0006774368713814811
First of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?	0.007609971260677812
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i.e . the vehicle owner , who pays .	0.00022614163251036905
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle , which is a bottomless pit in financial terms .	0.13102262103004048
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays ' principle .	9.221056038434847
We should apply this principle rationally and calmly , correctly targeted and without ideology .	0.11827474263311681
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope .	7.138023312698035
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point , but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts .	1.29745766921614
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry .	9.61619688263188
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe , if we are not to water down each of our specific identities .	0.5026527380030131
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts , and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision .	0.3791547922724133
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43 .	17.607129317718687
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis .	5.542952219226009
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena .	8.435883964020048

(NL ) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .	5.155878208585927
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .	6.265407543710519
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among others , scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully .	0.031190203189063626
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety , for example , are nonsense .	0.0020031418179524397
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that .	14.803103610853807

I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements .	7.121933613717126

There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution .	0.07976388931022618
However , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives .	0.26623631092579414
When it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .	0.014483702314661052
In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .	1.166027731431242e-05
As is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money .	0.01907129324637909
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut .	8.016239316608175
No one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity .	0.0016037544593598407
Thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials .	0.01927105106359842
Of course , these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .	0.08294972844213759
However , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .	0.004864753340154406

Berger Report (A5-0007/2000 ) This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals , for the provision of cross-border services .	0.2881885350383964
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union .	3.9393560617293946
Until now , the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh .	0.08228153712084074
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier , even when they are nationals of third countries .	0.5394811138692804
Nevertheless , the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence .	0.5109826076613733
This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted .	8.244605322749068
This means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers , but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services .	0.8025527379618993
On the other hand , for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report , one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State .	0.1539742934528631
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000 ) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000 ) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services .	4.214563832642832
Basically , these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States , a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits .	0.26124138854098977
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there .	5.187947635084899
According to the terms of the directive , the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned .	0.2927171001117062
Logically , in order to be given such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme .	0.06043327527234169
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals .	6.502204102399087
While , basically , I subscribe to the European Commission proposals , nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion .	0.00104065963300958
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .	8.2517288130275
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading ! Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures , for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards .	0.6808503633010988
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions .	6.320510354256944
I can , therefore , only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended .	0.0006304944201009782
We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems .	6.761250532114763

Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000) : We have serious reservations about the Council ' s proposed amendments .	0.08780786442184742
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched ?	3.8539862731473074
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter .	9.556677717905593
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them : On 1 January 1995 , the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994 .	0.09833581765280118
In May 1995 , during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the CFI , concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases , was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role .. .	0.015516619498792412
in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial. ' So what was done at Amsterdam ?	0.11951258379646935
In that respect , nothing .	0.0007590783825896957
On the contrary , extending the Community ' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden .	0.24698882971373468
You will agree , furthermore , that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction , and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up .	0.007030552372977794
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys , grudgingly granted , which we have become aware of after the fact .	0.16427676913724965
Consequently , these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake .	0.07299409634241505
They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred .	7.643742829307321
We cannot agree to this , since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States .	0.3586274079096173
The time has come , we feel , for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice .	0.026060749502335043
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity .	4.827179750552345
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?	1.83679641172073
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000 ) - (SV ) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .	4.195688387420922
We therefore , of course , support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.0009695114374109235
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place .	5.177877245242255
We also argued this in November 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 .	0.15743761095863815

(FR ) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched " .	0.40953268000778176
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is really a closet constitution .	0.5232439134217175
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria .	5.656789209108069
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference .	5.401575880652106
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of States and peoples , in order to increase the Commission ' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States .	0.23534029763227
Incidentally , the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament .	0.577387791649411
People will remember that this article , dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level , stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system .	0.21949405388075258
In France , both in the National Assembly and in the Senate , when this was being ratified , many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that , in any case , the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making .	0.001265474476751245
Well , today , the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam , who has , in the meantime , become a European Commissioner , Mr Barnier , proposes to decide , at the forthcoming IGC , that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision .	0.0
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions .	7.79341776328479
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making , but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent .	0.6504848934199329

(DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .	5.905231402935536
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities , such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament , which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU .	0.37701946633047934
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December .	7.359721796552954
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process .	7.009720401020905
That is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such extension .	0.12567199572113882

With the convening of the forthcoming IGC , the process of European Union is topical once again .	0.12928028662561403
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government .	6.416946189059163
In other words , fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide , behind closed doors , on the fate of more than 350 million individuals .	0.003165724285485421
It is therefore easy to understand the public ' s lack of interest , given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them .	0.6826694505065235
In fact , one only need look at the agenda of the IGC : the institutions , enlargement and European defence .	8.405834431640419e-05
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power , the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe , particularly by increasing military budgets .	0.12168629317218471
Social Europe , used as a foil by the EU , has simply been eliminated from the agenda .	0.0010033194665809689
All this does is to legitimise the development , on the European scale , of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers ' main claims towards the highest common denominator .	0.051380513487797395
This is why I am voting against the report .	13.400419028677156
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC .	9.182094373464974
I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency , which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament , of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States , large and small , as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened .	0.01638491247477017
Unfortunately , in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union , nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7 , which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding " principles of the Union , as laid down in Article 6 .	0.03148971680417261
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated , the Union has the right to protect itself .	0.11081275847098943
Nevertheless , the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance .	0.022985144825708514
Suspending a state is just such a process , and is to be condemned .	0.050624388786600416
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties .	0.37447609458722364
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda .	4.50706421019373
They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered , and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament ' s participation in it .	0.548804487477392
We feel that these issues result from the IGC ' s appropriateness and its objectives , as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there .	0.42823014465803305
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged .	5.01948888656162
This relates in particular to the intended agenda , particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers , which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future .	0.03254797154515082
This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars , which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union .	0.27031523724287565
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us .	9.117343730487875
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report .	8.987003631658407
The text is overambitious , and Britain ' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs " in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these .	0.09601972478374542
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions .	6.74439490062961
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation .	9.32028330096892
The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties .	0.3553917802863513
In our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are .	0.06578270205105298
Our priorities (i.e . the "left-overs " ) must be : the number and responsibilities of Commissioners weighting of votes in the Council extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended Beyond this , we have concerns that the "flexibility " or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .	0.003644478744168816
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation .	4.267894900887575
- (SV ) In order to be able to influence developments , the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution , which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999 .	0.31266024845336604
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki , so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion , including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests .	0.5527020863189032
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997 .	4.699538989199226
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .	5.413561413124364
I therefore , of course , support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.0009695114374109235
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place .	5.213648553735074

Joint resolution on Austria Madam President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jrg Haider ' s Freedom Party .	0.7268580196951183
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott .	7.0995870889487405
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty , as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples .	0.08648772751671463
Whatever Jrg Haider ' s verbal excesses , which we of course deplore , the Austrians have made a democratic choice , and we must respect this .	0.002387326203277602
In our opinion , it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament , in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena , have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period .	0.034033486038728834
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament .	0.2594443026957295
But , going beyond this petty political operation , what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria , which caused political life to stagnate and rot , may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results .	0.028052193244996144
In order to prevent this threat to the system , it is ready to do anything , including overruling the outcome of free elections , including setting up a thought police , including establishing a new form of totalitarianism .	0.004889630041824581
Madam President , on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national , the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano , I should like to ask the question : in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law , in contravention of the Treaties , in contravention of morality , who is pulling the strings ?	0.0014141132645171686

This needs to be said ! Madam President , I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider ' s Freedom Party .	0.016742039092292185
Mr Haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse .	0.020727048772626978
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler , praised the Waffen SS , and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma , but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government .	0.015577118999297302

The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 .	5.47354750763112
Madam President , we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jrg Haider ' s Freedom Party in Austria , which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part , and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people .	0.06699267757982941
We warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably legitimises the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this European Union .	0.0027660602766867238
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .	10.29529480996591
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens .	0.5249886993287369
I am proud to support such a resolution .	13.853931033963635
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken .	1.1712423621539714
I shall take the floor very briefly , Madam President .	0.008704497687794735
I respect Parliament ' s wish , as it has been expressed , but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question , even by the European Parliament .	0.007144551425743819
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament , and to members of the Austrian national parliament , and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests , but also of business .	0.008225123654642936

However , recent events - firstly , what were really threats by the Council of Ministers , then Mr Prodi ' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and , finally , the present decision - are things I cannot support .	0.0006711671593883594
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises .	10.76986782854349
What we have here , first and foremost , is an incredibly ominous mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union .	0.0014669022459754626
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but , worst of all , their effect will be counter-productive .	0.10434173410183484
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FP .	15.921773851604346
On the contrary , they will strengthen them .	0.01140055120862517

We attach crucial importance to applying , if necessary , the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which , by its actions , infringes fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU ' s Council of Ministers removed .	0.021614070537914833
- (EL ) The Freedom Party ' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union ' s political future .	8.399883454823957
It is a 'Trojan horse ' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War .	6.581823066890379
The European Parliament and the Union ' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia .	7.249478098159549
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements , the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because , by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU , their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition , they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways .	0.09417943493314271
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider ' s party , as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers , we voted in favour of the compromise resolution .	0.3435725094948437
We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms , in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery .	0.7773633009792597
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious .	0.47553566952157317
Some of these parties , despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic , adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right , either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy , if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment , and generally making their lives more difficult .	0.00572435258097415
More generally , those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy , devoted exclusively to the interests of big business , has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders , and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right .	0.0647204438975244
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe .	10.725820273274946
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jrg Haider ' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government , a situation without precedent since the second world war , the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community , a large market , a "Europe of shopkeepers " .	0.040421912257831295
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now , part of its very essence , its heart and soul .	0.02240580038625214
The European Parliament was the first to speak up .	29.233677881408074
The appeal by the European Socialists , on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel , raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation .	0.07130026650748576
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly , through Mr Guterres , by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control .	0.05355698944944688
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe .	6.85819283710198

Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .	17.45536867284123
However , as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will , since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply , will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure ?	0.03943712411014437

I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .	0.03769401809217412
Personally , however , I shall continue to fight against the extreme right , to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria , and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m .

Such a concern is misplaced .	52.098753616998636
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree .	13.511822646625273
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism .	25.246752528913742
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities .	10.484546036549421
It is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union , to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament .	0.07933049715421812
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government .	6.145539263945153
We are nonetheless , as is our right as well as our responsibility , telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand .	0.09322362392190203
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement .	8.46835970302445
Such a view is not only a political cop-out , it is positively dangerous .	0.08690061364023381
In reaching an agreement with Jrg Haider and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success .	0.7912593995491097
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria .	9.328722515832514
- (SV ) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism .	7.710046968514179
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jrg Haider stands for .	6.672942983394818
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue .	6.388712024223349
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States ' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty .	5.614947711639907
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU ' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider ' s electoral success .	6.057843344974599

It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .	5.240020208353368
It has no right to do so .	12.945892602651899
Instead of prematurely condemning the FP and the Austrian Government which is being formed , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition .	0.602737309465599
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe .	5.837907676384861
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider .	19.827357392889237
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FP .	8.326078326472947
However , as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FP at the elections in October 1999 .	0.45629762324445616
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results .	10.029666804926212
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FP can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics .	7.125328328558809
However , the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem .	0.42574142247621966
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution .	10.352476958874325
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books : that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good ; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests ; that it bides its time in bedrooms , cellars , trunks , and bookshelves ; and that perhaps the day would come when , for the bane and the enlightening of men , it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city. " It is with these phrases that Albert Camus , at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague , reminds us , at the close of the Second World War , that the fight against Nazism , "the brown plague " as it was termed at the time , could not enjoy a definitive victory .	0.0

Confronted with this threat , which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe , nothing must deter us : not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit , not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene , not the derisory respect for formal democracy , and , above all , not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control .	0.006505921758945656
As the representative for a French overseas department , the island of Runion , a land of racial and ethnic intermixing , where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans , blacks from Africa or Madagascar , enlisted men from India or Pakistan , or even Chinese , every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupry , "In being different to me , you are not doing me harm , brother , but enriching me! " This human diversity is our main sources of wealth , and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .	0.0

The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism .	6.034203413140681

Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria .	11.92663873135393
This precedent , created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency , is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned .	0.010886952306970706
On the one hand , the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought .	0.11620097758949624
On the other hand , if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies , then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed .	0.10694507690246888
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?	1.5544057055947176
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future .	8.466603034643072
- (FR ) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety .	6.228437927757394
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated .	10.532770817193336
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union .	9.816077887595739
I urge the Commission to be less cautious .	36.68165657904852
In this resolution , Parliament is assuming its responsibilities .	0.013923780676526946
Having said that , in my opinion , the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .	0.000632287567254796
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line , and I supported Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group .	0.00036856025323128965
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party .	6.6109213660265285
Including Jrg Haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries .	0.7463045523943693
The Austrian People ' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this .	7.053010822621903
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here .	20.068352434157855
As the democratically elected representatives of the European people , we have no choice .	0.07776200369341287
We must reject what is unacceptable , as our constituents demand .	0.03062176529017944
Because , when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces , failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation .	0.003069013207450458
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution .	13.394140254831314
I condemn Jrg Haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy .	19.82427072613898
However , I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State .	0.15384603425056517
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right .	0.044580101969904085
- (SV ) Obviously , the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party .	0.2971797011837958
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State , just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority .	0.40178283411891075
Finland ' s experience , however , is that integration , rather than isolation , is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces .	6.332942667331146e-05
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights .	0.12306258260588493
The EU Presidency ' s "common reaction " against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified .	7.338242911688939
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States .	6.865224151643362
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights .	5.776972544839643
Despite these objections of mine to the Council ' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics , it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism , which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote .	0.32707781624709664
That concludes the vote .	54.18960324811599
Adjournment of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .	9.942755305425566
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m. ) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000 .	0.05084192805572375
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed .	5.532382653241648
Are there any comments ?	1.0899764773977065
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen .	5.824097876713847
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this .	0.3892175855708623
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes .	16.53455452407035
Madam President , on a point of order .	0.0005444882577981246
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are .	0.023251637905905956
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible .	1.032553841964867
Madam President , since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors , may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House , but is also published on the Internet ?	0.0069942707813436325
Thank you , Mr Davies .	1.8614268489258466e-05
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors .	11.628875589083925
Madam President , on a point of order .	0.0005444882577981246
As this is the first Valentine ' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest killer in the European Union .	0.9549309051230186
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease .	4.940701644130958
Happy Valentine ' s Day ! Madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning .	0.7623402927124371
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices , because that would be a very serious matter indeed .	0.9775320261448155
In the past the British Conservatives ' double standards have brought the United Kingdom ' s House of Commons into disrepute , and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament .	0.6946421046726696
Thank you , Mr Murphy .	2.70691565194422e-05
As I informed Mr Davies , I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors .	0.17292937125612184
Madam President , on a point of order .	0.0005444882577981246
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House .	6.499294998682161
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking .	13.281261460580337
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC ?	2.7822809217679545
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe ?	0.300898045913642
Gentlemen , obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes .	0.32158792744831804
They will look into the matter thoroughly .	30.19038508306738
Madam President , I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease .	0.7115213152188037
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success , or to say , "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms " , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation ?	0.0050269280379115966
This is why , Madam President , I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which is unusual and unwise , to say the least , to contribute , and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi , towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace .	0.0
Thank you , Mr Wurtz .	1.5467295732447536e-05
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start a debate at this point .	0.0015519975529651793
This was just a procedural motion .	29.14708104060492
Let me remind you , Mr Wurtz , that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow .	0.0010797133275316838
He is going to make a statement on the Commission ' s programme .	17.60234727155202
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement , just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you .	0.39567756953253264
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees .	0.16383306137793596
Madam President , it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before .	0.14939275817689254
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we , on behalf of the Dutch contingency , would like a Dutch television channel .	0.024806200409902484
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament , including two Greek , one Portuguese , one Finnish and one Belgian , but still no Dutch , and as many as seven English , six German and six French .	0.00013752305367185262
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January .	10.34902346497115
It is now February and we are still waiting .	29.20743780903697
I would ask you once again to work on this .	14.064668000975585
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite .	6.56584315478935
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel , let me say how disappointed I am , because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago .	0.013534946336587835
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you .	6.972006520555298
I shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion .	0.008956783630721134
Madam President , as my dear friend Elly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy .	0.00497317651999716
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection .	0.7154277847849551
If it is of any comfort to her , the Irish have not got their channel yet either .	0.14346901234544038
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it .	9.312692973463784
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .	16.696549599675205
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel .	6.628413583641626
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel .	9.139929971902118
Thank you , Mrs Banotti , and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this .	0.00043246774706895316
Madam President , I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission ' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that , until proved otherwise , we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable .	0.02371907178624837
Austria , therefore , is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled , and even duty bound , to offer Austria his best wishes .	0.0010030834271291206
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party , the French Communist mayors , were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France .	0.03875275815552596
Agenda The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents , pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .	0.28352394463679564
a ) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday : President .	0.07418348412578088
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening , a number of groups - the Group of the European People ' s Party , the Group of the Party of European Socialists , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok ' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda ' s report were brought forward in the agenda .	0.057773399951927276
This would then give us , for Wednesday ' s sitting , the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights ' sitting , followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda , Mr Corrie , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knrr Borrs .	0.006407698016774548
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?	2.186758376932881
Since no one wishes to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote .	0.0744569513646638
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday : President .	0.00746717838418733
I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .	7.435687130921844
On the subject of human rights , I have received two proposals for additions : one from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia ' and the other from the Group of the Greens , for an item entitled 'Pinochet ' .	0.011265000743226559
As you know , we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights ' section .	0.09397482458482748
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda , there are already four items .	0.15656861953506046
We can therefore table only one additional item .	21.86755039715038
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia ?	0.13864298219992488
Madam President , it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet , despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued .	0.04738323763856625
Since the Belgian Government ' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken , it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message , a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial .	0.2126305430151229
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament , which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .	0.02139069808455526
Madam President , this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time .	0.08126650873824173
Firstly , the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet , but , furthermore , there are certain questions to be borne in mind .	0.0004941969540371062
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries , and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system .	0.5086712872789582
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court , but it does not yet exist .	0.1502930836022476
Secondly , there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile , led by Ricardo Nez , whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice , and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system , which is independent , is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet , concerning his crimes against humanity .	0.0019123275035708147
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up , but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure .	0.5985833431026384
We believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .	0.20171870853155968
(Parliament rejected the proposal ) President .	38.53446797342569
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube ' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance .	0.41409544744903504
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?	1.800447830951017
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster .	0.04953516334054657
It affects not only Romania , but also Yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire Danube basin .	8.796273432119625e-05
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation , and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .	0.5775277049140931
(Parliament gave its assent ) President .	34.330026890512954
Still relating to Thursday ' s sitting , the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschild ' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda .	0.6704041236405743
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal ?	2.1651184991420944
Madam President , the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal .	0.10482522041306513
It is not a very time-consuming matter , but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays .	0.533235074396324
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting , which is an extremely urgent matter .	0.11925579652513107
We have tried to drive this proposal through .	21.38499124380137
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it .	12.030308256803668
(Parliament gave its assent ) Relating to Friday : President .	0.01663213363243536
Relating to Friday , on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels , as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda .	0.30675675104002514
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal ?	2.0839305229325276
Madam President , with apologies to my friend , Enrique Barn Crespo , I should like to speak against this proposal .	0.00029508739894448197
I am surprised it has even been made , because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents .	0.2040292045827145
I think that your proposal , Madam President , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date , is a reasonable one .	0.001007364305310707
The reason is as follows : this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union .	0.12000177779528919
We already have a directive .	49.166472354299586
It is not an old one , it was issued in 1997 .	0.06547733854448438
Deciding upon future policy lines , with a view to a new directive , rather hastily , without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners , I feel , runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators .	0.00651503162855307
I propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date .	0.0008177282888783093
Madam President , I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation , and I am going give this explanation before the whole House .	0.004004789520933317
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents .	7.2835078610700545
At the time , I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter .	0.04258777515543934
My group has debated this matter and considers that , given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area , it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week ' s debate .	0.041969849920153804
Madam President , I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about .	0.08464076878740488
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance ; it is just about the following question : when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive ?	0.08531729407660746
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible .	0.4590100822283718
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday .	11.983697734806542
(Parliament gave its assent ) Madam President , as you know the Cederschild report has been taken off Thursday ' s agenda .	0.23895918976126335
That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday .	17.33068944826761
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half , I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time .	0.38648638352221226
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic .	9.256008262868386
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote .	4.367144536614191
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .	6.104778502006964
That is absolutely absurd .	100.68511396603292
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed .	10.939451804252313
This sounds perfectly feasible .	89.700229458909
We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschild ' s report .	0.24090860641230002
This is all I am talking about here , just that .	0.010875980318016003
Madam President , I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday , which you have not yet announced .	0.00814872087265881
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration , on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March , so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way .	0.04296184672476004
I understand that there is agreement on this issue .	16.16245206678429
Madam President , this afternoon , in this Chamber , reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning , which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House .	0.0036923515727133593
These are serious allegations .	83.83879711183121
They are completely untrue , malicious , politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood .	0.008602436765126616

b ) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative .	5.501275923487766
(FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament ' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III .	0.005860369105076799
Upon referral to committee , we examined over a hundred amendments and , so far , 17 amendments , some of which have already been presented in committee , have once again been tabled .	0.00012539582719143944
Before discussing the content of the resolution , I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur .	0.35626298242015353
First of all , I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative , founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation .	0.025289895670498153
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale .	9.53619438790575
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006 , and is the one with the largest budget for implementation , i.e . EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time .	0.0008454113829054346
The INTERREG initiative , created in 1990 , is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers ' in the context of establishing the great single market .	0.07711720498651983
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996 , the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks .	0.627408236421046
These programmes promoted cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area .	0.2876001462721528
The INTERREG III programme , for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission , pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds , continues these measures .	0.022564584091718107
It is based on three strands .	43.93797692811842
strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions , at both internal and external borders of the European Union , on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States ' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing .	0.1199013661739212
strand B governs transnational cooperation between national , regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development , transport networks and the environment .	0.03021261386328439
Member States , i.e . national authorities , are responsible for implementing this strand .	1.569043776808262e-06
Finally , strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development , subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation .	0.2789217655378619
The new INTERREG programme , in the form in which we have received it , takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions .	0.09822899717799405
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows : between 50 and 80% for strand A , 6% for strand C , and the remainder for strand B , i.e . from 14 up to a maximum of 44% .	0.00048262490645040504
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B .	9.591369614528864
It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period .	6.470369572690564
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B .	11.417132552209075
The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive , but is comprehensive for strand B .	0.30634252651052685
The Commission reserves the option to , at a later date , put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions , for strand C .	0.006391667874325367
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds .	8.78102507352817
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission , which checks their conformity with the general guidelines , adopted .	0.025312866928151774
These proposals must include a number of elements , an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies , a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan .	0.0820289521012205
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme .	8.476352240040272
I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme , which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency , but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation .	0.10169088596736403
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in , as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January .	0.41236473194784373
I further regret the fact that neither the regions , nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme .	0.18875527389924562
In promoting cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory .	0.07974135082611582
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union ' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture , to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services , and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life , diversification and job creation .	0.022523514288309045
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed , consisting of the following elements : an integrated , multi-sectoral approach , simplification of administrative procedures , improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment .	0.0025401636649417247
In its 1998 policy paper , Agenda 2000 , the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based : the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas .	0.01983169635075843
The first principle means creating a new 'pact ' between farmers and society , making the farmer 'steward of the countryside ' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside ' s recreation value .	0.8074601171416137
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented .	0.7441898943525799
In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP .	10.644947166542558
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs .	4.864352437259916
The following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas .	0.013015823418268438
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b , and 217 local action groups participated in it , with financing of EUR 1 155 million .	0.06385374102257148
LEADER II (1994-1999) , for which a total evaluation has , unfortunately , not yet been completed , had a wider scope than LEADER I : there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated , after reallocation of resources , probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million .	0.00028119705297590037
In October 1999 , following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II , the Commission decided to extend the initiative .	0.0069105199786070794
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million , and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set .	0.005286167845288623
LEADER + differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible .	7.672444085416115
It is also more ambitious , and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet .	0.22794393567992663
The main changes are as follows : all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+ ; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous ; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes , such as the use of information technology , improving the quality of life , and adding value to local products .	0.002949007223694614
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because , as I was saying , it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious , even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities .	0.11506661272905068
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence , such as the Carrefours .	1.238342600490532
I share the Commission ' s preference for the use of global grants while urging , however , that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined .	0.05770180019550055
I regret the delay with which LEADER , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure .	0.07367178464814889
Finally , I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II .	0.00841136978007653
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments .	0.6175752693267573
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative , whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .	0.04839720349474476
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities , and the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .	0.0008589726387473898
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion .	0.9467166956512142
The initiative adopts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships .	0.16682933110532014
The intention is clear : targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities .	0.0014784972804878895
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House .	6.193278640812928
In addition , EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans .	0.1687602273072379
It is an important Community initiative which , together with the three other initiatives , URBAN , LEADER and INTERREG , is financed out of the Structural Funds .	0.00034491366264530015
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships .	5.535286905471481
I consider technical support to be necessary but , given the problems with the former TAOs , no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament ' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level .	0.18213390673594582
Nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .	0.005022452092167978
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming .	0.32259016211716973
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report .	10.989646685331921
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises .	5.729477530499333
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .	10.998790050209326
However , in this context , Madam President , to allow us to work out the details , I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday .	0.001411441432873756
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament , because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members ' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative .	1.4305076826638752
In this connection , the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament .	0.3582551927347037
EQUAL should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention .	0.07130178672031735
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union .	5.213166615704043
It should prevent society from splintering .	37.799079454173295
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life .	13.512155122057095
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .	0.28385872687720204
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support ! Madam President , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m . but I am here ! Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative .	0.1670342842347652
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000 .	5.5886089483946595
Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn .	0.04604886236788973
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy .	12.476316790099315
In my Member State , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities .	0.02679448015512022
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation , social exclusion , joblessness , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that .	0.003212991979318513
For example , in my own region , in Manchester , the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success .	0.00010048979686537419
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK , in Moss Side .	0.20203887599829903
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community .	4.642934484231264
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs .	4.952426303570336
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity .	11.115380630713135
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity .	0.25252193272647705
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes .	0.30772999400511375
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .	17.244719506539685
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor .	9.553651742754175
Instead , we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect .	0.09620540383850333
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations .	10.230229904888033
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas .	4.824851247677679
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes .	4.716765596982002
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria .	13.042457577736196
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .	10.560298101190334
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion .	0.016377407345157927
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .	7.4621238958887375
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime , drug-dealing and gangs .	0.10227603626992299
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .	14.32207808295506
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity .	0.40924528972937085
That is why again , in my report , I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , "mono " problems .	0.004859933951222825
Instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions .	0.05544302631341727
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination , as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty .	0.20971497912753806
The Community initiative means community involvement .	37.79908770761375
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .	8.766854002379766
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes .	10.847812924773264
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious .	24.950967350009435
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation .	5.195383798203114
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice .	4.396760878989423
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .	17.393475558976576
Finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation .	0.3613611712297351
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .	0.30390069920102136
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and alienation with equity , initiative and participation .	0.005937980458262212
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems .	7.044802460302489
.	1.0
(IT ) Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mrs McCarthy , has already pointed out , we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations .	0.0034169155246528884
As we have heard , the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities .	0.08645857323487739
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation , action to combat poverty , measures to assist low-income groups and old people , facilities for children , racial and ethnic integration , better opportunities for participation , a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures .	0.0041897822004662195
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic , social , and infrastructural measures .	0.021966314363247242
However , we must remember that , in addition to URBAN , a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector : innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation , pilot projects , particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities .	0.007824063133686783
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion , the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding .	0.46744920075241253
While , on the one hand , we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary , we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved .	0.024574890370638706
Not only is this coordination essential but , as we stated in our opinion , exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential .	0.03239255255459432
Mr President , the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe ' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood .	0.4390398529326578
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities .	0.3965112675487585
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities ' historical and cultural role .	5.801373276838375
However , in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis .	1.0607229569813665
Here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women , and the agencies that represent them , in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes .	0.004623009691111031
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities , we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women , mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments , and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations , social solidarity .	0.006290987236951241
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels , thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms .	0.9378492382957682
Mr President , our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention .	0.27106085565445787
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN .	4.741761152684019
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration .	6.699557473997604
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning , action to prevent juvenile delinquency , the reintegration of offenders , and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved , for example the police , the courts and social services .	0.0132453432453463
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because , as we see it , programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence .	0.5602568113399133
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .	10.452629990498567
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives , INTERREG III .	0.37247772487156416
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III .	7.512096669373386
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative .	6.768875051148514
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect .	4.6559041593718895
In reality , however , the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects .	0.015109271874137017
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures , especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment .	0.5263124170881329
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B , especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy .	0.3100752284100284
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing .	3.8304862423665282
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise , although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission ' s support programmes .	1.108384541912829
However , I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal .	0.2167252343501473
It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves .	6.704299055105789
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism considered , amongst other things , the report on LEADER + and , as a result , agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions , believing that that process could be effective on two conditions : that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community , and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER + resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities .	0.0026834414303084256
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements : political representatives and public administrations , companies and economic operators , and social operators , including unions and non-governmental organisations .	0.003291284821481101
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies .	8.455645115040207
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in Objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .	0.07025832248857841
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+ , but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union , and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion .	0.3221603397355986
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development , in particular based on local traditions , techniques and practices , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy .	0.021816020018063372
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that , given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations , the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants .	0.14340586808172084
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 , financed by LEADER , with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership , such as INTERREG , SAPAR , PHARE , TACIS and MEDA , in the same areas .	0.0006951059258643561
Mr President , Mrs Stenzel , ladies and gentlemen , before addressing the EQUAL report itself , I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based .	0.0013376504942601319
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .	0.23934350193558973
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy .	6.018677011705097
However , the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self-determination .	0.5012059029430923
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .	5.496492905570056
Mrs Stenzel ' s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned .	0.0006419720931639261
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes , although this should be self-evident .	0.20327353380150212
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee .	12.702165293442926
I would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to marginalise people ?	0.02299993629713143
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so ?	2.4079891265601168
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability ?	1.6158652827589748
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme , because there remains a shortcoming in the report .	0.20592998231562137
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crches should be built .	6.590290371335851
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming ! Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention .	0.1748338472070776
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .	0.5911973738792254
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions , which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .	0.16262141365371915
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise : firstly , for example , the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities ; secondly , the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly , the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies .	0.013768360900477965
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure .	21.135639392108246
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments .	15.921787110997698
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change .	0.9366155916319662
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme .	6.220948144934825
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme .	6.235362535153579
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators .	5.429102095746935
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .	17.996760039322826
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time .	0.0009658650368623895
However , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .	0.18352166142827933
The reports are late , and , in addition , they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .	5.862333861372269e-05
A good opportunity to discuss the results , good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost .	0.21769825368107537
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union .	3.9495735299410724
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either .	0.001089855626159147
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG , TACIS , ISPA and PHARE programmes .	0.07446718416353934
This coordination is at present lacking , and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .	0.18826148223658654
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible .	6.102189656944952
It is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .	0.23367721143417053
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful .	6.923277331143667
Projects have often remained half-finished , and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy .	0.10420426837024772
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement .	6.349024460228119
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .	7.679383696440071
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statements , has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission ' s guidelines .	0.02483121084484894
It will not work as an automatic target , but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions .	0.24601454402044476
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .	10.155561164866038
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds .	0.0015476851750093785
Here , projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries .	0.03243995879313269
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money , that is only for the borders within the EU .	0.12843745695328726
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation .	7.0264410520956995
The regulation pretends that there is one , but there is not .	0.03158743819762456
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years , although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time .	0.4218054449925262
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded .	7.216708288146212
Since 1996 , Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties .	0.1456251320985044
Nothing has happened ! The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist , to the detriment of the regions concerned .	0.19279641718810606
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners .	0.5742946213562358
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers ! Mr President , a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes .	0.5318288206330095
According to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this , deprivation within regions , towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved .	0.0009882701859182503
That is a question of solidarity and progress .	36.77986438494056
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .	10.806382864958056
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience .	8.799884654896763
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes .	9.43165222367948
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly , but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval .	0.24305410582732623
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted , local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux .	0.498197422378633
The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans .	7.147705335444049
In some cases , I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems , but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union ' s blessing .	0.10620424756877947
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union .	3.768399748501959
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux , consultation and control , and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place .	0.06350970836127139
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants , the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States , this squandering will generate even more protest .	0.15559563328383
In the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion , Mr Nogueira Romn , on LEADER .	0.0010153448046069293
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas .	7.338135774601401
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas , we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality .	0.6359544712328339
After all , innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding .	0.0849300485131476
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils .	8.358531620836288
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces .	0.20010729995576268
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied .	7.862271995204154
In this respect , one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model , the structurally planned cooperation between government , trade unions and employers ' organisations .	0.004619066999590319
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population .	7.231077400176324
So , really , these bodies should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .	0.0030803164638879147
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play , as their input in society is important in our view .	0.4079763779917969
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start .	4.471127665270882
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that , unfortunately , democracy is not fully functioning yet .	0.01550776840628373
One of the objections is that , due to the restricted role of the elected bodies , businesses gain more influence .	0.012203079940647447
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few , it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils .	0.9098529721660714
We believe in 'one man , one vote ' more than 'one share , one vote ' .	0.0034792413134571284
Mr President , there are economic frontiers within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time .	0.00039098737656663527
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe , of which there are over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment .	0.14377870111863705
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita .	7.680713434658159
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure .	7.2229472728336175
That is why , when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund .	0.04704620828118654
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road , water treatment facilities and related transport networks ; secondly , the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment , which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe .	0.00287692557678037
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone .	10.115697561517438
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small - and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well .	6.232883398736177
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + scheme .	0.006615268102451479
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development , combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes .	0.6327061345882858
Mr President , quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation .	0.05943097143706054
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .	9.142437025454136
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and , if necessary , give additional support under URBAN .	0.028050257191056777
Over the next seven years , the Commission ' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit .	0.4240918583607901
In common with Mrs McCarthy , I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced .	0.16495679095205376
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget .	8.529880637766887
As far as the budget is concerned , as already stated , URBAN is there to support and complement national policy .	0.010482619264826484
In order to generate extra means if necessary , I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors .	0.3838582844074762
Consequently , we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .	0.00886210886810369
In addition , I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where Community contributions are concerned , should incentivise .	0.00045363867114728165
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence .	29.45107165543148
We would then be overreaching ourselves .	41.22018471000127
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG .	11.52511776939303
In my opinion , funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions .	0.20580153839444346
When projects are implemented , it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation .	0.11126247169706548
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998 , this is not an imagined risk .	0.2889031213576108
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects .	11.47624104820119
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives .	5.704970694366691
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four .	0.013874683397824886
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded .	15.809653347752663
However , the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems .	0.126753485205889
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines , although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds .	0.44414344801623934
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III , the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding .	0.41263019606578544
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects .	16.960890930131225
When INTERREG is implemented , it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned .	0.1778161650286029
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed .	17.557089408579483
However , problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE , for example , funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related , whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis .	0.00479088556752126
This will cause practical problems in the future , and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively .	0.2304912836223182
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas .	0.019704906773780104
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - LEADER + - is therefore greatly to be welcomed .	0.2392644270970687
The new LEADER + programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union , which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects .	0.18263884571599429
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER + and the other support initiatives in the European Union , but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important .	0.40270234833501956
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects .	8.426126680676383
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome .	8.154333396933643
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative .	10.290974124901643
In the same way , through the LEADER initiative , structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas .	0.013360526401026333
Attention must be paid in the LEADER + programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas ; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result .	0.4600692291691371
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase .	21.867549224974212
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission , which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible .	0.4559049089573024
Five months are provided for this .	19.26098504295689
That seems to me to be rather too long .	16.48962128026428
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times .	20.102871493613012
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .	4.944176855663688
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+ , I do still have one further concern .	0.19988115876838083
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER + programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented .	4.793326211646126
For me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?	0.006131720869057638
How will these people be selected ?	1.3458995798260496
Where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be located ?	2.3448689586384275e-05
I do think , though , that the LEADER + programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks , which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case .	0.018829455760256523
In addition , experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that , apart from rather dubiously creating jobs , they are not of any great benefit .	0.0023460295887522092
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER + programmes run smoothly .	7.8871699320929896
Assessment and publication are part of this , and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past .	0.08913732412336789
Mr President , the majority of the borders , which have divided Europe for centuries , were artificially created , separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion .	0.0012995309744069051
Our internal borders , or what remains of them , no longer cause wars , but they do continue to generate economic backwardness , social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe .	0.0025132171028664834
The Community ' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars , which contradict the spirit of European unity .	0.4069999893258237
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based , by means of the INTERREG initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent .	0.08577179005358272
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory .	6.12006433121591
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative , our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II .	0.5838915410971148
However , we are aware that we must not delay this third version further , since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway .	0.11153655012777319
The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local , regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects .	0.3848325265076439
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together , of innovation , of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other .	0.040913290959837006
There are many interesting questions relating to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc .	0.00404384417905374
However , I would like to concentrate on the management bodies .	0.04274936889278363
We must create joint , interregional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .	0.000702701943695849
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .	9.20425655576535
We must create a cross-border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State , in each region and each municipality .	0.03905571580464074
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication .	10.84426242843469
During debates in committee , we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments , such as MEDA , TACIS or PHARE .	0.005478774308038954
This Parliament ' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties , making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes .	0.7796255378799724
Mr President , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area .	0.016349442636332805
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds , if not thousands , of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage .	0.04207468146284037
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos , in situations where there are inadequate facilities , where schooling is very poor , where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife .	0.050796699797448594
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families .	6.49079323262263
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland , as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries .	0.17176957606890303
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there , but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes .	0.3957532181881523
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative .	7.969165066754615
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme .	4.7401975953968
I should like to make one further point before I conclude : we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy .	0.7219773818576104
This , unfortunately , is not the case in Ireland .	6.0505032482275134e-05
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market .	6.7499713363656495
The development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental .	0.11029353112608672
I have two major concerns , however , about the development partnerships .	0.0002508519107149902
They should be accessible to smaller groups , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programmes .	0.014337429771286532
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .	12.137999097144005
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone .	0.399885065282313
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all .	0.42818493761773635
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems , for example , disabled people ' s access to the workplace .	0.009438981058648039
Projects should also specifically address this problem .	17.578685006029357
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes .	11.893159177404723
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands .	8.664725302944568
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees .	10.871539902532415
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation , having access to EQUAL , I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees .	0.11532760361726542
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else .	8.813050356251063
Thank you , Mr President .	8.48832596874919e-06
Ladies and gentlemen , with the LEADER report , rural development is very much to the fore .	0.002549792809008713
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying , especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union ' s rural development policy .	0.46071468730592047
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning , but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as , for example , areas experiencing depopulation .	0.01651485877333138
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme , local operators have combined forces , debated and prepared projects .	0.033471490489420254
These programmes have , therefore , been important channels for participative democracy , the rationale of the citizen for Europe .	0.00028238261196512774
So , the concept for LEADER + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .	0.11408742023656819
One urgent question is therefore raised : why , when this programme has been successfully run for ten years , is LEADER + still classed as experimental ?	0.0007183287923525908
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?	1.8592692348903668
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development ?	2.650615640972489
Moreover , I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+ .	0.17225975753384237
At a time when , Commissioner , after Seattle , we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects , why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient ?	0.0015376218109487475
As an ecologist , let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches .	0.3759554676781332
In this connection , the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries .	0.17308746745938253
A better solution would be , as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism suggests , strengthened coordination between LEADER + and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes , such as INTERREG , PHARE , SAPARD or MEDA .	0.0002230432503574579
The fact is , showing solidarity with Eastern Europe , is all very well , but it is not enough .	0.0002449001079669431
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south , particularly the countries around the Mediterranean , must not be abandoned .	0.03584716216653239
Therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision .	0.006778453487619472
Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type , which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application .	0.15029391855471433
Mr President , I have a few very brief comments .	0.0025549395898080544
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period .	6.235167082096852
This is not very good at all .	36.99812746724993
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud .	0.6313270189288024
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions .	9.351778759181087
They must , however , not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self-sufficient role .	0.0020599720137202053
For example , adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts .	0.18875956619681797
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more , to the benefit of more developed areas .	0.3068766840133666
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas , islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas , such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece , whose omission from Annex I of the Commission ' s communication is ill-considered .	0.03246531584967231
Mr President , rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler .	0.004131783587369568
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but I suppose better late than never .	0.13208785925994826
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000 .	0.3326651741087082
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms .	12.46133153578088
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .	12.1662719573661
As the Commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities .	0.2578902727140297
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development .	7.194192830165467
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative .	12.325222151034543
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems .	6.0100349125055486
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .	11.990855856722158
Yet , through LEADER , there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy .	0.007825911821721335
In conclusion , while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+ , I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme .	0.025509264055042936
I urge you to look seriously at this problem .	15.184027948893881
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers .	6.86473137370648
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative , and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrire ' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and , particularly in the context of INTERREG III B , with the Commission ' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector , a sector in which many associations , especially cynegetic , are already making enormous investments in my own country .	0.0
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and , finally , in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border , transregional and interregional cooperation .	0.05531720964229158
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which , in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B , involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000 , which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems , from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted .	0.04539190166802415
Finally , if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit , I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and , beyond that , of similar initiatives .	0.01124724060876161
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned , otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens .	1.048794559320601
Mr President , first of all , I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report , Mrs Stenzel , very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us .	0.0025325049506523616
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .	0.6567917452695827
This is an arduous task .	69.80234569852448
Only , the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped .	0.09939892282053135
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different countries or the different components , but especially between the different groups listed in the programme , and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date .	0.028769152605747774
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .	7.459342558123888
I , for my part , have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them .	0.059874145456597395
Although a few other groups have been mentioned , it is the Member States , in particular , which are on the lookout .	0.00021318262648705613
For example , I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugees .	0.011556238691064128
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .	0.0016607015961658245
It should not be the case that one Member State , under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group .	0.045925434256802754
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently , to wit , that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend .	0.19144802427141724
This is not the case ! It has to be redistributed time and again .	11.030539809417354
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister ' s treasury funds .	8.280633582712975
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .	15.945239539804886
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solved .	0.0927077171642316
As far as the Commission is concerned , I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament , mainly with a view to reaching a balance .	0.08853948407307981
I would just like to underline this - the situation is , of course , a little precarious - Parliament has , for the sake of convenience and safety , placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being , so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed .	0.005899869138017079
I believe that this is actually a good thing .	22.77778257716533
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .	12.478083087761997
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful .	5.865532391667071
Mr President , there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union .	0.07386824446709055
However , I should like to stress INTERREG ' s particular importance for the Balkan area , where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country , Greece , which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula .	0.014473554477155946
For Greece , for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria , but also for Europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the Balkans , bringing political stability , is a vitally important matter .	0.0001718428745223688
So far , some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes , while others have not .	0.0032591618929538467
During the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations , such as ISPA and Sapard , it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries .	0.06552219441533298
Accordingly , we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission ' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG .	0.3202401594765905
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally , and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome , so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme .	0.299865981087556
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean ' s geographical peculiarities , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions .	0.9468214869943009
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review .	6.79973898035807
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives , which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions , and to foster their harmonious development .	0.051734101301977795
And since this is St . Valentine ' s day , as a former Mayor of a regional city , I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love .	0.02102164763450593
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles : preservation of jobs , stewardship of the countryside and , not least , local culture , because that is of the utmost importance .	2.148634685809251e-05
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured .	7.784018247371173
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating .	8.430030265521967
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside .	7.529314068236285
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore .	7.96057908000629
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has , since it gained new currency , become relatively devoid of meaning , but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed , amongst other things , is an integrated approach in the countryside towards , for example , tourism and agriculture .	0.0003947425805978096
The investment needs to be visionary .	58.40702158389037
Young , creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside .	0.13612617851805503
If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more .	7.9713008624201915
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate , all-round distribution , and the pilot projects need to act , as it were , like avalanches and trigger other similar projects .	0.0009328370188400613
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and , even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there , overall they were certainly positive .	0.06733880828126736
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps , the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada , from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density .	0.20282786624629287
Mr President , I want to talk about the EQUAL report , especially the issue of the policy on refugees .	0.0029752366668944416
Last week , we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government .	0.02512941519213628
Today , we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government ' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel , who is the author of the EQUAL report , of course represents Austria ' s governing conservative party and its policy .	0.016302934112955008
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention , that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees .	0.4801866325020729
In actual fact , it is the other refugees , namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid , who need aid the most .	0.002602963207816668
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions .	6.259858469569067
Some members of the Committee , however , supported Mrs Stenzel ' s proposal and wordings .	0.0023920406479442783
As I see it , this means that Mr Haider ' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament .	0.1683172905888609
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme .	6.618235739680958
I want , finally , to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but , when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees , I have no misgivings .	0.002335445241841336
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time .	14.842709147450915
Mr President , during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative .	0.0034684919650761373
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States .	0.542714121931886
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States .	4.427613683843431
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland , I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III .	0.5312564843207953
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .	0.5334078456821061
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years .	7.204505270510368
The European Union is the single largest contributor , with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland .	0.2168741366091112
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme .	14.431617662108723
All in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process .	0.028039319190294888
Mr President , I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG , but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time .	0.005307647500778137
We have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross-border cooperation .	0.6593316130401983
However , this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation , for INTERREG IIIA .	0.04043684257187962
Therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand , regarding the selection of eligible regions , is wrong and contradictory .	0.004575091523796089
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament ' s position in practical terms , and not just with a formal tribute .	0.48658687362073116
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and , where exceptions have been made for maritime areas , their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies .	0.09756988443357645
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature .	6.14867384587169
This is in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies .	0.4153145273139645
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta .	6.920538145196853
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions .	4.259185289788544
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions , including the French overseas departments , have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative , opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area , even though it is true that more could have been expected , particularly with regard to access to the various strands .	0.0021392589082565297
For a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland , ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours .	0.005586991765991597
That time is now past .	57.52168820524289
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to , not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples , hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment .	0.18261293585153016
This increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .	0.00019717193028989685
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets .	11.932734883383993
So , for example , the island of Runion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia .	0.013852690735349296
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area , lest it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean .	0.05227335217639425
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much despair , if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds .	0.21313540662266922
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas , giving it worldwide scope .	0.28446431933692806
I am counting on the Commission , and specifically on you , Commissioner , to allocate adequate resources for effective action .	0.000336066437841465
Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas .	0.007008712764529668
I understand the Commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation .	10.369280139856357
Nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .	0.06030246587119642
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this .	5.911977349076335
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation .	19.59241648346358
In consequence , I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B .	0.37794961629469287
These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects , particularly those of an infrastructural kind .	0.35166584410097423
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU .	5.515302697590641
I hope for their adoption .	57.5216888711666
Mr President , our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that , if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem .	0.022743433828832295
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared .	11.067846769446264
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level .	6.918191947221825
We are concerned , therefore , as others have said , at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society ' s most excluded , by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee" .	0.0026841900435547613
My group will not be supporting those amendments .	27.161036231834704
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which , in seeking to introduce greater flexibility , run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative .	0.05415973445820373
Mr President , I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems .	0.08846556139933193
Yet , there is some risk of dilution of effort .	0.02454219211936803
If we pursue too many objectives , our overall effectiveness suffers .	0.04476855217962179
Of course , every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case .	0.023278353497287692
But there is a common factor , a hard core , comprising unemployment , the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises , both commercial and other kinds .	0.0018602120427933496
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation .	7.042889983051573
For this , of course , central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy , so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries , and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings .	0.010154634990994968
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrire ' s report .	7.45664626404402e-05
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory , most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions .	1.1158126409518956
INTERREG must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two - or even three-speed European territory .	0.019067237236918912
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities , and their representative bodies , the Committee of the Regions and , of course , the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme .	0.006983520235106625
Indeed , I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication , published on 13 October last year .	0.03627986864005779
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III , I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme , financed by the ERDF , and the other external cooperation funds , including in particular the European Development Fund , intended for ACP countries .	0.0028128484828912966
In this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds .	0.052938852056661594
The most remote regions , particularly the four French overseas departments , must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund , in turn , cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas .	0.003145015928535214
Furthermore , I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication .	0.6118551473799412
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III , just like all the other regions in the Union , especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped .	0.11447242651892768
Finally , in conclusion , I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C , for interregional cooperation , even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable .	0.0022138062864130717
Mr President , my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women , although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which has a feeling of dj vu about it when you are my age , in any case .	0.006073155492748272
Unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .	0.11945136159853985
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .	0.07256576479661027
For me , equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny , alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job .	0.0787831322447243
If that is the case , we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times .	0.0800980292348401
No , equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life .	0.13650168879570743
Unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .	0.0174216787379911
On the contrary .	113.21937655734001
I think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i.e . that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies .	0.0004233666021538027
One can only hope that it succeeds .	32.147550617478565
I should just like to say , in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions , but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on .	0.19894534687410806
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , those who work on rural areas know that , of the programmes which the European Union has managed , the LEADER programme , both LEADER I and LEADER II , is one of its success stories , and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+ .	0.0003008358308956781
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned .	7.0188098495267095
I am glad that LEADER + is to remain true to this underlying concept .	10.968503787725993
There is a problem , however , which we need to address together .	0.0005157466426732961
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach , a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were .	0.9788761846570375
And because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER .	6.904139038517584
That is why , where the good LEADER projects are concerned , we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued ; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable , positive component of our support to rural areas .	0.025848228461840296
Of course this is also the basic idea .	31.253377252179526
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non-governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .	0.003707142654023229
Here we must ensure that the good schemes , those which are really excellent , are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work .	0.06320331056902738
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted .	9.864292957929377
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation , which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known , pushed a little on to the sidelines , say because of official local or regional policy .	0.04385041879151977
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far .	9.049278127945968
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic .	6.986912887441845
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy , including ourselves at this level , could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well .	0.05452341616421008
That was the charm of LEADER , and that should please not be lost ! Mr President , I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups .	0.1619127173432395
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender .	7.22357849724443
This is why specific action for women is needed , as well as mainstreaming .	0.10021136592242325
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work ; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed .	0.9016841844535566
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects .	7.434665299865048
The development partnerships within the thematic fields , which are referred to in Amendment No . 22 , would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative .	0.005562740356118814
My group will be supporting Amendment No . 22 .	0.013674433243860445
Mr President , the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance .	0.024195562015950463
In addition to the objectives it is working towards , the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries .	1.0643877122563439
In my opinion , it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas .	0.4826205800936368
Indeed , these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union .	0.6197388111311218
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up .	0.08280977310517934
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic , as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which , inexplicably , are not currently included in strand A , Annex 1 .	0.011357091559134372
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament ' s position on the matter , in accordance with the Code of Conduct .	0.5165739507156997
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions .	8.125234390153949
Finally , it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes , which are significant for external policy , as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes .	0.02285577715571273
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , LEADER I was an outright success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators .	8.29662980797413e-05
It is , I think , regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II , regarding the quality of the projects , the quantity of appropriations spent and , most especially , the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered .	0.000649879047394817
I am pleased to see , however , that under LEADER+ , new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development .	0.008427654463564688
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment .	0.670343862506632
The time is now right , I think , to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation .	0.010583933112406078
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II .	8.997360655431724
Nonetheless , if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas , within the scope of this initiative , remains available , then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas .	0.005098232438832937
There must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .	0.0005190329790018492
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring , in particular , that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II .	0.052552677289350654
Mr President , as a Member from one of the outermost regions , I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned , because of the debate on two Community initiatives , URBAN and INTERREG .	0.0037653470104824257
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed , firstly , in the case of URBAN , at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities , and , in the case of INTERREG , at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union , particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C .	0.0034723176686730843
Like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA .	0.14746621014796965
With regard to INTERREG , we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation .	0.40525724260737717
I would like to thank the rapporteurs , particularly Mr Decourrire , for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments .	0.015810292788166317
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .	14.69011959705004
Mr President , with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon , I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that is , the URBAN programme .	0.00031329816374150163
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained .	8.951922458456886
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives , but Parliament ' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained .	0.7446556853733002
I believe that we should be pleased about this .	19.754351398948238
But what were the Commission ' s arguments , from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular , for eliminating the URBAN programme ?	0.007404031639331572
Its argument was one of priority .	36.15084609089467
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget .	6.610695507682916
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important , that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme .	0.4910940308791796
However , I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General , because I think they were absolutely right .	0.029160795838679567
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .	7.896605107352238
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe , I believe , clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail , not to prioritise and , therefore , not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities , by means of European funds .	0.02342294818851535
Therefore , I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas , factors which are on the agenda , and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect .	0.03537207400084501
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative , it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular : physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility , visual information systems which exclude blind workers , working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems .	0.048660942141125284
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making .	6.862750827652735
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group .	0.36948932325010964
Disabled people have too often been left off the list .	10.749815758880997
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group .	3.7327724452356015
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own , in the east of England , outside the principal funds of Objective I .	0.011007314513517429
We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .	7.906017758656632
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex .	0.05741621296497737
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk , many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels .	0.8099739615943344
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market .	0.5314294097503309
Finally , a word on INTERREG .	0.004145191561657206
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links .	5.750487985041238
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands .	4.010993451410783
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas , particularly on maritime borders .	0.018885640671607407
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the information of the House , Mr President , I should like to make a clarification .	3.922319554783783e-06
Chancellor Schssel ' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima .	7.373973635060899
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria ! Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU ' s territory and 25% of the population live in them .	6.560870824732317
As a farmer and Member of Parliament , I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole .	0.23894091868095688
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone ; I refer , in short , to the multifunctionality of rural areas .	0.04279457829418837
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER + programme because of its comprehensive nature .	11.999639013556768
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU .	5.091106891082196
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .	5.617263245576157
In the future , funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone .	0.15946433557771136
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument .	8.719323177195049
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be squandered recklessly .	0.22300990174495955
In addition , I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy .	0.10647572831780447
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside .	5.308904584140588
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers .	11.055867983335325
LEADER + should supplement already existing programmes , avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible .	0.4813900080839487
In this way , LEADER + can , together with the programmes under Regulation (EC ) No 1257/99 , consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside .	0.02366105915073673
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament , but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work : it was created following an initiative in Parliament .	0.0026985022901815647
The Commission would have abolished URBAN , but this time Parliament drew the longer straw .	0.10176189895050455
It is good that URBAN is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .	0.10783694151392254
The problems in Europe ' s urban areas are getting worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the Commission .	0.006765661799329605
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities , and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves .	0.4604045961855387
There is an immense risk of exclusion .	29.017339793294386
In many cities in France and England there are now slums , breeding grounds for many sorts of problems .	0.24113753540011668
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe .	10.116844003603047
We have to act now , before it is too late .	0.04089672077869302
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe ' s economy .	10.1152637923604
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy does not support the individual sufficiently , nor is it sufficiently dynamic .	0.028098043815530282
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment .	9.798456217274643
This is not policy ; it is life ' s simple logic .	0.051309221027136996
It is good that spending has become focused , as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds .	0.18336410931154667
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities , as they do not have enough resources .	0.33256811698909633
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas ; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand .	0.4796756767637187
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship , as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally .	0.48266249651903265
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again .	0.11767941568128046
Mr President , with the implementation of INTERREG III , European cooperation policy is entering a new phase .	0.0010039811106010111
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones .	10.094542725845038
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation , the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions , particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe .	0.10321227162340052
The Union ' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation .	0.05487766321608741
By means of amendments adopted in committee , Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission ' s work , by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid , and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe .	0.02740028489114128
In its draft guidelines , the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past .	0.11451024824788467
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries .	8.3830942356753
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005 , boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union , and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective .	0.1475471788097865
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work , we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward , in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies , and that it will confirm , with fitting amendments , the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries .	0.03135092850034447
Mr President , from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds , but only 5 % is set aside for the Community initiatives , INTERREG , LEADER , URBAN and EQUAL .	0.0003428674114465079
That is a reduction of 3 % compared with the previous CIs . No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL , as Mrs Stenzel ' s balanced report makes clear .	0.02651000220972354
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing .	8.496663591660942
How are priorities supposed to be set here ?	2.356373266314955
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced .	0.2239948565795261
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .	10.762314237740654
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs . Criticism of the previous Commission ' s work was particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices .	0.010717192688035867
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was , after all , in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO .	0.027824961717674592
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either .	8.24106787299143
It can only approve Member States ' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria : firstly , integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships , whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account ; secondly , the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local , regional and national authorities , training institutions , universities , NGOs , the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership , and thirdly , methods and models of indisputably innovative character .	0.0
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices .	0.48726131395535277
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved .	8.319184770203016
Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP .	0.0910832443956891
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP .	7.187371995056302
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382 .	8.722089642505601
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important .	5.9648487974257955
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme .	8.708763542820403
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy .	6.412089643249734
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important .	12.315284152944896
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers .	7.444272741060505
Regarding information and training , in the past this budget line has been allocated for information , communication and training .	0.005375362289576082
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included .	15.175459299768903
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP .	9.00104589407899
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future .	4.744827091191197
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments .	26.066798017006256
I would urge Parliament to support them .	32.227868620791384
Mr President , I am taking the floor to express my opinion , drawn from my experience of municipal administration , that the URBAN projects should , or rather must , have a threefold purpose : firstly , to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic , old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities .	9.535718896622819e-05
Secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .	0.013510075485905992
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit , with new pavements , with newly paved road surfaces , all whitewashed and beautiful , if we are not able to fill them with activity and , therefore , employment .	0.00030893044532552316
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators , but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment , or to put it another way , projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs .	0.08115544000171325
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families , because man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man .	0.15287557594007825
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society .	0.03940058705959739
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .	11.830221821957766
If we have success in this threefold sense , I believe that these families , these people , these European citizens , will believe more in Europe , and this seems to me to be very important because , ultimately , the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life .	0.0003298263202170496
.	1.0
(FR ) Mr President , before my friends and fellow Commissioners , Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou , in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG , which many of you have brought up and discussed .	0.029996118718876762
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees , from all the committees , but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives .	0.2658929894028487
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN .	13.578462525911759
I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her , for all you owe her as far as this is initiative , as well as , more generally , all we owe Parliament .	0.03460335233993682
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties , in favour of sustainable urban development , involving at the same time this integrated approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspects simultaneously .	0.015611731643511451
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy ' s report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes , on the basis of a real partnership .	0.021488205915521877
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission ' s proposals and Parliament and , having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions , I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made , with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name .	0.1286770016680921
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments .	11.830186601882646
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns , which a number of you termed arbitrary .	0.3080814286297341
I can understand your concern .	44.531465498217344
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees , firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or , in exceptional cases , 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding : we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear , and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities .	0.13483398344060601
That is my initial response to the threshold question .	22.881336514286488
Regarding a second matter , now , relating to the additional criteria , which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas .	0.0007840589394019906
Here , too , I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project .	0.045854913013515845
Third point : specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women , but also immigrants and refugees , must be envisaged .	0.0017260614271604443
This concern , ladies and gentlemen , lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative , and I am willing to rewrite the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clearer yet .	0.00016585614671276995
Regarding URBAN , I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure .	0.00022955341022930117
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding .	0.011302704753215263
Ladies and gentlemen , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States .	0.00685812542113835
As far as the Commission is concerned , it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes , indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did .	0.05115400005317411
A second observation , the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes .	0.32290764209976963
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .	9.612132608732502
This cannot , however , be grounds for an extension of the original time limit .	0.00038007581151081076
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months .	10.592186295816363
This time limit , which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs , should normally be adequate , I feel , for drawing up a programme , which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage .	0.00274449481160252
With regard to URBAN , I should like to conclude with a final observation .	0.09065601720368224
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative .	7.175895354536949
I agree completely .	191.93154808051537
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning , a concern to which I devote myself , that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate , my concern , as I said , that , apart from the URBAN initiative , urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes , and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them , beyond the scope of URBAN , in all structural fund programming .	0.0
But , as for the future , since we must look ahead , I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspectives , a new European regional planning policy .	0.003301761577720123
I am not forgetting , and we cannot forget , that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important .	0.049093953873261986
Let me repeat what I have said , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming .	0.2489220877978788
I should now , Mr President , like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur , Francis Decourrire , in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work .	0.0005022246855459311
He stressed a number of points , with which we may indicate our agreement , as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation , with its three strands , cross-border , transnational , interregional ; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG , its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds , and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations ; the importance of common structures and what , in discussing another debate which begins today , the Intergovernmental Conference , I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with INTERREG , thanks to INTERREG , is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners .	0.0
Having made these general observations , I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG .	0.19438607871703611
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .	11.114915472813689
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date , stressing , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted .	0.0030308885744148935
It is true , I admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .	0.00027490925353329656
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000 .	10.718262095177616
I accept this ; I take note of it as you do .	0.03671738253586329
I note , however , that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now .	0.02390066399712435
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January , if the programme is presented before 30 April .	0.6482738479755712
So much for the first comment .	56.86706375061655
As to the second comment : regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B , I wish to inform you , to confirm , that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects , particularly in favour of small - and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage , in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one .	0.010694872840876217
Third point : interregional cooperation , the importance of strand C .	1.7881672597445408e-05
The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C , interregional cooperation .	0.09910164655180326
As your rapporteur has requested , I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand .	0.30408292243904705
Fourth observation : the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office .	0.021480220520860897
As you requested , I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems .	0.821596001254963
But , ladies and gentlemen , if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials ' jobs needed to do this work , because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely , at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA ) and in order to ensure that , the Community appropriations for which I am responsible , often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States , are monitored better , with discipline and transparency .	0.017076035096566144
Now to the implementation of INTERREG , a subject mentioned by many of you , and the potential eligibility under strand A , 'cross-border cooperation ' , of schemes in the Adriatic , on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions , the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points .	0.0003979510009730383
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B : 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions ' , so as to cover , in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions .	0.05381203547771399
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States : greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B .	0.40363065475426535
Thanks to these two overtures , especially the first , I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG , and with other instruments too , as soon as they become available .	0.024726396640315364
I have decided , in the end , that the most remote regions , to which I attach particular importance , will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions .	0.0030799040069858998
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .	0.3037901637391159
All this should make it possible for us , apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them , to confirm the role of 'active frontier ' of the Union .	0.04221883210594555
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union , even if , or precisely because , they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear .	0.04538569677196732
Another point : the coordination between INTERREG , PHARE , TACIS and MEDA .	2.820582836757896e-06
It is true , once again , and I accept this objectively , that there are still real legal problems .	0.00017400030210486776
I do not want to minimise these , but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned , even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain .	0.1626558056260756
The Commission must continue along these lines .	31.34045079575312
I am making a personal commitment to do so .	9.218472885830222
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination , and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this , together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen , Patten and Poul Nielson .	0.019794222531558287
Finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you commented .	0.003318577441322282
It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance , if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general .	0.7208041705234995
According to the general regulations , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20 , and not Article 23 .	0.006139101597214175
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .	0.2761954466132228
I attach great importance , ladies and gentlemen , in a spirit of discipline and transparency , to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information , and not to propaganda , and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union .	0.003521963865908088
My conclusion regarding INTERREG , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this .	0.006290830776311851
They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union .	9.268594384954586
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .	0.05585976278532971
I remain at your service in order , when the time comes , to present the report of previous planning which you request , but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning .	0.02930650171288171
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you , and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrire , I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar : only EUR 700 million for URBAN , but this is better than nothing ; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG .	0.011107349824498531
So we are working within this framework and not outside it .	14.896073667220067
On the subject of these two initiatives , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees .	0.03684394202194019
Everything that I have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account .	0.020663877372357812
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report .	0.0011919943522878942
However , I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER + initiative .	0.649924331067866
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas , ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models .	0.6805442484422175
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission ' s view that LEADER + should be applied in all rural areas , that overriding priorities should be introduced and that , above all , active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged .	0.025818413600422925
In addition , I note that Parliament shares the Commission ' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER + is the use of global grants .	0.18550050038303378
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today , I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+ .	0.4877911708771366
The various groups , be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment , have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives .	0.01994317854071129
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more .	0.17579313444211628
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new .	9.323757334168976
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II .	8.51375407953996
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups .	7.856209229882732
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget .	9.845985701780739
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned , I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy , which means , in our view , that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER .	0.01901954637544323
I now come to the content of the report .	10.044151020200575
In point 14 , Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately .	0.21048377003385182
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because , as you know , it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed .	0.175903939874664
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme ' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation .	7.965043930443073
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .	8.209054947876995
In point 18 , Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives .	0.09519460643870088
In response I can only say that this already exists .	20.56271647752692
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested .	9.26703972548045
In point 21 , Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER + now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start .	0.48846318317302617
I can only fully share your concern .	30.808169195141872
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament , the guidelines for LEADER + will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November .	0.7153330842198192
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April .	12.723203277355479
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER + programmes .	5.720076724015477
I believe that it is important to point out one thing : expenditure effected under LEADER + is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running .	0.7050592916811993
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January .	6.273812841421461
Finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines .	0.16558409266476987
Having given them thorough consideration , I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted .	0.006425349713899325
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER + is a maximum of 5 months .	5.516125650364199
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has , in our view , been overtaken by events because , following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee , this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament .	0.0076635968509772626
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 .	13.719016558567725
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed .	8.002594696942994
I must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States .	0.011434426537094767
An amendment was therefore made in the committee , but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament ' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form .	0.4923538626593679
It will also continue to fight for Member States ' acceptance of this .	10.89453455094715
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .	15.199259421455908
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept , Amendments Nos 3 , 12 and 13 .	0.005560103798077293
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .	10.882066161091386
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time .	0.014872242303854167
Recently , because of political developments in Austria , there is growing unease within Europe .	0.0011663711840912124
Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue .	17.83787125987828
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies .	10.575789297230248
We need specific proposals , both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies .	0.39971034929578575
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible .	4.2421398910743395
I now come to the EQUAL initiative , which is , of course , based on Article 13 .	2.4767283189586085e-05
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13 , namely the fight against discrimination based on race , gender , age , and special needs .	0.0008505027516606357
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel , because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex , both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue .	0.2780085476001613
The first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned separately .	0.008118213444720905
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about , but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination , discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place .	0.1110651714236855
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today , the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way .	0.23961441778447326
I would like to remind you , however , that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared , the fifth programme for equality between men and women .	0.016908522579292942
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups .	11.936225845653873
Firstly , the enlargement of the thematic areas .	0.010884500315310288
As in employment strategy , there are four thematic areas : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities , and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament ' s proposals .	0.000583856675107075
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination , I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination .	1.012453166444292
The second subject is flexibility and simplification .	23.37533530290121
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand .	7.161129008575819
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp .	0.300501822780087
As regards the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the thematic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector .	0.015162674925390494
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs .	8.671189203793734
Of course , a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience .	0.0047878098357255925
Finally , I would like to mention technical assistance .	0.0185994389731345
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available .	9.165208174444807
First , funding for preparation ; second , implementation ; third , mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and fourth , technical assistance .	2.1157876095699134e-07
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided , we must say that external offices will be used .	0.32317926531633506
As Mr Barnier too pointed out , it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission ' s staff .	0.44605943847605556
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested .	0.4571022875543975
We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised .	6.7180623121139895
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible , both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned , in other words , we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000 .	0.06382328065403169
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees .	5.760001814109469
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .	20.90233016456113
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m. ) Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed .	0.054963391177961084
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them .	6.860139774930761
Are there any comments ?	1.0899764773977065
(The Minutes were approved ) Madam President , my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m . Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here , because the 2.15 p.m . Air France flight , which normally brings us here , was cancelled , with no explanation from the airline , and we therefore arrived very late .	0.0
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament , we should take measures to prevent this occurring again .	0.123013900097824
Thank you , Mr Medina Ortega .	0.00024728702248658205
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation .	25.15415086106844
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government ?	2.579176368203888
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .	13.18513651454929
Madam President , I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday .	0.011674516407834717
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union .	4.8595771805219785
Absolutely , Mr Napolitano .	0.00013596511174656338
Thank you .	1.0
Madam President , off the subject of aeroplane delays , I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , Caroline Lucas , who is a British Member .	0.001319867374255709
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow .	7.637665461817883
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent , she was still held in custody all day .	0.46386978575718424
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology .	5.703527528321735
I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague , Mrs Hautala .	0.07218077608476596
Thank you , Mr Lannoye .	2.056811110396064e-05
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative .	10.435913261853981
Madam President , I should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report .	0.2405128765047535
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .	6.5475086054858735
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL .	0.22365916149634968
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .	5.0553146541627605
Madam President , to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made : Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane .	0.02279851471973873
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest .	26.708600059869482
I have , however , no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity .	0.0009200443975744902
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane .	24.450152621455572
I did not hide behind any immunity .	35.592914366989056
I took the punishment that came to me .	16.206794219994027
Mrs Lucas should do the same .	15.6602757806592
Madam President , I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow .	0.15626179925837919
In fact , this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee , and , given that it is a major Commission proposal , which refers to the agreements we reached last year , I consider it admissible .	0.0005378779090969956
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups , so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible .	0.7624396040321394
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel ' s request , as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti ?	0.028988127120638175
If not , then we will proceed to the vote .	0.002889408985903892
(Parliament approved the request ) Madam President , under Rule 29(4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group .	0.5953199286585461
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group ?	2.2820688143718666
Mr Corbett , I have not received any notification .	0.0017520272979391009
Madam President , I am amazed at Mr Corbett ' s reaction .	0.010128269852025045
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here .	7.105876076268315
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past .	4.570623957572787
They have our full support .	33.72397162483246
(Applause ) Agenda With regard to the agenda for Thursday , following a request made yesterday in plenary , I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m . when the vote will take place .	0.004949945891145975
(Parliament gave its assent ) Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000 .	4.519470469682477
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .	0.02195848857996744
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking , and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech , which is available in four languages .	0.0016737751341419698
To respect my speaking time , I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme : a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century , when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective , a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation .	0.024325343416278334
Let us remember that for half a century , Europe has provided us with peace , security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity .	0.07295741002699199
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery , which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies .	0.4744179660190758
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made , but it comes at a price : it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries , which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries , banks and public services , even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go .	0.03368835217465516
Nevertheless , despite these aspects , European citizens are disappointed and concerned : by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough ; by a Europe trailing behind in technology , and seemingly falling even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too ; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times , starting with the Commission itself .	0.002202752632219937
The crisis in the Commission was , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens , and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this .	0.006887307889921552
Even stronger still , however , is the sense of insecurity , the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards , a world which is completely changing , where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference .	0.0012261313293108647
This is not the first time this has happened : Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation , an explosion of its markets , a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world .	0.018249924703527376
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down .	8.0446521917305
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge , giving rise to great nation States ; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium : headway in science , technology , economic progress , defence structures and military organisation , philosophy and literature .	0.0024834926310862973
Today , Europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been unforgiving in the past , it will not be forgiving in the present .	0.0005377701379968847
In this context of wholesale change , and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again , in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges , Europe needs to be economically strong , because globalisation demands unity , because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too .	0.013188708086833398
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena .	9.262162857575193
In years past , the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions , the mainstay of European life .	0.02304565427401922
Today , the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based .	0.005931372173393726
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005 , a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar , so I will not go into detail about it now .	0.11659621549868505
Some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes .	0.14475003229073025
This is the European Union , not the Soviet Union .	0.011808809558045604
Our programme highlights the major points of reference , the major areas for action : firstly , the development of new forms of governance for Europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguarding and improving quality of life .	0.0
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .	6.32412892536089
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since , in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact , the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate ; we will subsequently discuss the content with you ; this will give rise to a policy document , and finally , a legislative document .	0.018861121506369344
This is an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe .	0.20649342752506242
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us , an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions , rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30 , and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level , at regional level and at local government level .	0.10884355137846975
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink : as I said a few moments ago , it is also economic and political globalisation itself .	0.046336606221038676
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved , starting with the important issue of the involvement of women .	0.10213327603792345
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital , as women ' s involvement in economic life , an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe .	0.21391187072994214
This is a field where Europe has , nevertheless , always been in the vanguard .	0.0014359488061164722
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institutions - Commission , Parliament , Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies .	0.013604019094603757
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper , although in order to finish it , we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference , and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001 .	0.023624469954313238
It will not be a philosophical Paper , but a practical Paper , full of focused proposals .	0.003920489923429464
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink , and we shall therefore do two things : we are , and will continue to be , fully committed to internal reform , and we shall rethink our policies in detail .	0.0018881884901306904
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo .	6.817744886250424
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are , what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities , thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries , regions and local communities .	0.023295709424876746
So we shall be freeing up new resources , but - I fear , and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will , in turn , be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks : I am thinking of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affairs , health issues and environmental matters .	0.003202660884403573
When that time comes , when we have used up all our resources , I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources , but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on .	0.0690253535018925
As for internal reform , you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one .	0.16814821103174774
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform , if it does not become more efficient , if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors , starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid .	0.13307880611060138
Providing aid rapidly , when it is needed , saves human lives ; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all .	0.002545168977565328
When I speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans .	0.08187933360135206
There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems .	0.2961029943131809
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts , of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication , but I also think of new events , such as Croatia , where the situation has changed in a few weeks : the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia ' s problems , but more particularly Serbia ' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia .	0.025891486996167307
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans .	13.962378876260928
We must increase our efficiency in this area .	10.225283676177519
We must reopen the Danube to boats .	27.267992410545734
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource .	5.643008821517578
We must decontaminate the river and , in view of this , over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem .	0.05846479812833828
We have done a lot in the Balkans : the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures .	0.029012853787815866
Nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .	0.014870742040547837
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union ; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation ; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic , pluralist society in these countries with institutions , public structures , police forces and a structured civil society , but , above all , we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region , as regards both politics and the economy .	0.0014015309003640708
If we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .	0.07711885963358946
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources : it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon ; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy .	0.17841460566990805
This is what we need to do for the Balkans .	18.813655599812268
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage .	0.8489299520588676
We are clearly , once again , returning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .	0.0005369231143416384
We have made many promises in this regard , but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread .	0.4534970667898256
Indeed , enlargement , which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete , objective criteria , and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and , to an even greater degree , public opinion in our own Member States .	0.002399886422041389
There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .	0.0034229629158781714
I repeat : we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance .	0.29431684116235807
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans .	0.03648492678059421
There are certain other key issues : relations with Ukraine , relations with Russia , relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly , the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history , and for security and peace in Europe for future generations .	0.004621921311966226
In this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa .	0.04648087634831095
In recent times , Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help , but nothing tangible has yet been achieved .	0.011870810165035873
In recent years in Africa , we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy , but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes .	0.037937568783781205
Africa is , for us , a worrying topic for discussion .	1.4214051500866334e-05
We therefore have another duty at international level , which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade : the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries , not just in terms of writing off debts , but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world , with a great deal of willingness on our part , which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice .	0.021670340976268958
We need to provide alternative answers , otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe ' s positive roles in history .	0.8133008168965956
All over the world , Europe ' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities .	0.542524878982104
We should remember that we , the European Union , are a union of minorities : we are all a minority within Europe .	0.00038092460798714423
There are concerns even within the Fifteen , concerns which may even surface again in the next decade .	0.1690468910371946
I am referring to the situation in Austria , where the Commission has remained true to its role , being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union , but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties , ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy , law and respect for minorities .	0.005279260302870059
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schssel .	8.117743778707293
My message to you is : do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content .	0.36996344073287957
Reread the letter : The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty , I repeat , Article 6 of the Treaty .	0.01155324050706519
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected .	6.726040369948884
This is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supranational structure , maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties , but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts .	0.013650163382066547
Last November , the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive .	0.00814152228834566
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion .	5.85767983768738
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme : the economy and quality of life .	0.13066565085361012
I have already talked about the economy : we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs .	0.35607016593124713
We must continue to keep inflation under control , proceed with liberalisation , ensure more competition , encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies ; push forward with science , and push back scientific boundaries , and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science .	0.0012173882744462316
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .	0.23769442664328558
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .	7.325024612390501
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers .	8.652231616468107
Finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .	0.03222213909940945
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector .	0.308651939362442
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment .	5.934516318530053
The time has come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in Europe .	0.004375693553766162
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred .	9.079665164428063
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .	10.100287002695435
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing .	8.618184224400933
How will we judge , ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , the five years of our mandate ?	1.599821861555328e-05
How are we going to assess the results of these five years ?	2.634779836113869
I do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together .	0.19744819769334762
Let us take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next European elections .	0.08843536462371766
If it is higher than at the previous elections , it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge .	0.25811223666636984
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with all these major political challenges , but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway , we are also faced with major opportunities .	0.0008948364741292819
This , ladies and gentlemen , could be the decade of Europe .	0.00020318380039240858
Indeed , I would say that this must be the decade of Europe .	0.060283655114693836
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate .	0.07628572870756836
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .	11.709320510401481
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given .	10.121997778465234
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes .	8.13591802796199
Europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , reunite our continent .	0.002099345014756693
A demanding , ambitious , perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success , Mr President of the Commission .	0.00011884535856920916
However , we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present .	0.6014249533476232
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully .	13.651990958026587
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union .	8.778000201041673
We in the European Union are one Community .	41.196690134421104
We belong together , even when there are problems .	0.019509276481420843
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe .	8.416082710405112
Mr President of the Commission , you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks .	0.14947501217250056
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties , and that is indeed your role .	0.0706661214056107
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .	0.03411469205725576
(Applause ) Mr President of the Commission , our objectives are one and the same : we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century , a democratic Europe which is able to act .	0.006035152773407754
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and , at the same time , looks after its global interests with dignity , patience and convincing self-confidence .	0.017738481474466144
Europe ' s message , the European Union ' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .	0.003018352851126978
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world , which is becoming smaller and smaller , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .	0.016421720441592104
Seen in this light , globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a coming together than a segregation , more mutual enrichment than separation .	0.003849812834529617
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans .	11.257777385697256
Globalisation is not only an economic process , it is also a cultural process , which is why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace .	0.00021075682652183262
But we also say : we want to defend this European Community of tolerance , which is why a common foreign , security and defence policy is so important .	0.0031872166130430418
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today , bringing the European family a step closer together .	0.13595445057241967
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process .	16.45860104686747
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .	0.11169963248547676
For us , the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats , it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years ; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years .	0.10306099015932334
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact .	8.792622007054828
We need structural reforms in the European economy .	20.697682629151668
Most importantly , we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs .	0.05900064455943928
It would be Europe ' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe .	6.923977138317352
(Applause ) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays .	5.6444518814749705
We too want to help put Europe on its feet .	16.085385642709884
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity .	15.345581108506993
We support that .	139.10808286693538
The nations , regions , towns and communities of Europe will be preserved .	0.00014757960792308682
However , there is a current trend - the "fauna , flora , habitat " directive was quoted as an example - which , in my country at least , creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union .	0.013470808307863747
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .	4.761113487124226
Mr President of the Commission , allow me to close with these words : as the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats , we have every interest in a strong Commission .	0.008845230654882567
If you are persuasive in your actions , we all reap the benefits .	0.06136900406944723
In this respect we wish you every success .	21.330745605536837
However , we are also aware of our role as the Commission ' s watchdog .	0.14057834945197645
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union , and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case - , but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly , precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law .	0.1630869511161276
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world .	6.657799032109748
(Applause ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of , and the first ever debate on , the Commission ' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of ; as I am -for the whole legislature .	0.0012565805176195878
Firstly , this is welcome because it explains , to our fellow citizens , what we are intending to do and what we are already doing .	0.001958675193865423
We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future .	6.913751022896468
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme .	5.007730984616429
This is not entirely President Prodi ' s fault .	28.09262782084789
We are recovering from a crisis .	27.706625856239082
However , I believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme .	0.0024092861840928612
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .	12.205006848906322
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation , a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world : we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium , dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance , and we are living through a genuine change of epoch .	0.024153893550558206
However , to focus on the European Union as it is today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in Spanish , brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway - , the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government , and , since President Prodi always defends his home town , Bologna , I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand : the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti , which speak of bon governo [good government ] and mal governo [bad government] .	0.0
What we need here is good government , Madam President .	0.009348106595786332
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis , we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance .	0.20691283303618002
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget , and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission , last September , received wide support .	0.004806596528154359
In our opinion , this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe .	0.30136917152139353
I would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council .	0.05465809056748832
It is precisely this which , in a sense , is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme .	0.008932788105515118
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature .	8.132664638608913
On the other hand , we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a European Union at the service of the citizens .	0.013164414944583197
With regard to the events of recent days , I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day , and the week , that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which , given what we have said about the Austrian crisis , I believe should be fully included in the Treaties .	0.020908787619859693
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point .	16.68373475826954
In this regard , Madam President , I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .	0.005380399869040389
Last week , the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre .	0.08640847571821937
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments .	7.714109788559452
There can be no democracy without a living parliament .	17.480452213097774
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now .	9.87562224754979
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , I would say that we are very much in agreement .	0.6775764070669902
Nevertheless , I would point out to the Commission that , as far as the Socialist Group is concerned , there has been a change of priorities .	0.002964929573311824
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda , which also includes what is known as 'quality of life ' priorities , that is to say , the rights of citizens as consumers and as people , in relation to those questions which we always talk about , but never give sufficient priority to , that is , the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances , consumer rights , respect for the environment and sustainable development .	0.000875118859087155
When speaking of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that , these days , full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War , that is to say , employment for the male head of the household .	0.002920297531585217
We must argue for equality of the sexes , the famous 'gender mainstreaming ' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission ' s programme .	0.03970378410529161
This means prioritising sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat .	0.004339819206722697
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission .	7.639414259225503
It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise , in practice , the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone , given its prosperity and seasonal demographics .	0.04332464431752625
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .	19.517538217146793
In this respect I would also add another element , which is economic government , given the single currency , and I believe this is inescapable .	0.0017963114541933805
This is another question on which the Commission must make progress .	19.694300197361745
With regard to the ambitious objectives and , above all , the Commission ' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration , I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000 .	0.03544858097633706
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ?	2.6152378655029436
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .	11.659223717261183
With regard to governance in general , I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms .	0.1534027690741967
I would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here .	0.30411266464327275
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .	34.555145525938165
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is , I think that would be very positive .	0.24143313247664758
In all other areas , I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion .	0.08174806476193057
Not only should the Commission discuss this , but also our states , our parliaments and our civil society .	0.005103171445834333
Madam President , I would like to refer briefly to the last objective , which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental : the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe ' s role in the world .	0.012163565602954328
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe , with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts , as well as an issue which we seldom talk about ; the North-South challenge .	0.16416486992148713
We must not forget Africa , a continent which has been forsaken , not only by God , but also by Europe , nor our important contribution to cooperating with development .	0.0009397770731311162
Lastly , an issue for which we are increasingly responsible , as the world ' s foremost economic and commercial power , that is , Europe ' s voice in the world , which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round .	0.0011940052938738792
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions , for which Europe has an enormous responsibility .	0.24214996131332056
Above all , Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language , clearly , by changing to some extent the jargon which we use , because we cannot ask the Europeans , who are living through profound changes , to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible .	0.006373333556641644
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us .	13.648685478318827
I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections .	10.610429349404123
Mr President of the Commission , may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political .	0.041277780232839796
They are political because we are moving on .	21.472437000084327
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks , we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective .	0.5383369803079733
The challenge of enlargement is political .	41.83155572136869
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs , of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime , is very political .	0.013914296957934901
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .	12.288196530484878
Because it is political it is more complex .	20.75273205045129
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive .	17.348433782154338
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive .	21.47135845292719
We need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify .	7.145573258819719e-05
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .	15.286597961815898
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions , not just between Commission and Parliament , but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge .	0.07573583731973242
We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .	0.08891957282857164
We need more explanation of what Europe is about .	14.682996679026628
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties , because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself .	0.25870052939959326
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that .	8.412430446997279
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance .	7.249721642608619
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back .	0.08627652613606436
That could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority .	7.027646498876635e-05
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today .	9.390623677846229
For my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institutions .	0.001791542370308681
We see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of "them and us" .	0.10336444151292241
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states .	9.514667533577617
I suggest to the Commission , as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explains the value of enlargement , not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense ; a document , like the Cecchini report before the Single Act , that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand , historic challenge facing Europe today .	0.0023609636120926303
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .	25.084657267919695
On south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements .	0.14308690264444712
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe .	6.336093552676186
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more .	0.11190968330970699
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week .	7.9300067847720515
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union .	5.698711102334904
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid , trade and finance .	0.3742826272296178
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies , where we fit into UN agencies and so on .	0.0833245846470337
We need to open that debate .	49.85777654511963
In conclusion , this morning , the day after St Valentine's Day , the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over .	0.00023131917333789255
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not , Mr Prodi .	0.03446502788820459
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning .	14.973234214242247
However , we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business .	0.16319035008248226
That is the way it should be .	22.601917594632774
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe , an enterprising Europe , a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues , give in one adjective , one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enabling Europe .	0.008839836600339795
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally .	0.007586582050180783
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme .	10.97047870415733
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones .	7.348961526210089
At the same time , however , it has to be said that , unfortunately , your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto .	0.00015843562103737133
There are a lot of good intentions in it , but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved .	0.2521819630421331
As in any other party manifesto , it is full of contradictions .	0.044415565314577764
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .	14.994303843363923
First let me speak about the economy and social development .	14.009324303879183
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that is what was mentioned in your programme .	0.4993654054746338
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?	0.017279004703402222
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure .	0.32509082683228496
But , unfortunately , as we all know , this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act .	0.0006129933420009525
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .	14.883280717295431
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .	7.1909234784201015
In this respect , Parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision-making .	0.0001881667467906808
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation .	18.280372769675818
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration ' , as others too have said here .	0.3226589018967889
However , please learn from the events of Seattle : we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand , with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend , on the other .	0.001055487502677634
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community .	10.441042011808166
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic .	23.487190175625713
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring .	8.629834701416375
We can submit motions for this together with you .	12.914652364600903
Finally , I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this is another contradiction .	0.00020840907784312962
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC .	11.860255628041363
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making .	8.704818393716462
What you just said is absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .	0.06574021588777228
In my opinion , this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too .	0.4826179436054224
Madam President , my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission ' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate , instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary .	0.10118893035295794
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .	11.250342957040084
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and , in some cases , usefully clarified .	0.03245589919560844
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities ' .	6.950563831490471
The European Union ' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations .	9.108860980602092
Clearly , many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious ' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems , such as unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence .	0.008316409337893217
This must be one of our absolute priorities .	33.968707613039435
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success .	6.047034222926011
We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships ' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace .	7.6058762874231425
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion .	18.280372222732257
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised .	7.381195515942866
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make .	10.688940936392271
These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe , as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi ' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric .	0.8544940285448064
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission ' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners .	6.022218860539967
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication .	7.890936775936253
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace , stability , freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent ' and as a model showing the world the way forward .	0.06527338730866926
It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity , and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so ' .	0.3527644544195647
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .	7.474587890305957
Similarly , the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding .	0.846063740308274
My second criticism follows on from the first .	13.59295828926751
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and , where necessary , confronting these is seriously limiting the will , duly confirmed by Mr Prodi , to grant public demands .	0.0012584969615082404
For example , at least in the countries which I know well , I doubt that the intention , repeated three or four times in the Commission document , to reform 'Europe ' s social protection , health care and pension systems ...in a climate of more cautious public spending ' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back .	0.003041249564432669
My third criticism stems from the first two .	24.40681958892184
The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations , a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus .	0.6705042570960265
But all is not lost .	52.09875790549481
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed , provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity .	0.45062673881655796
My group is fully intent on helping with this work .	13.076755993288906
Madam President , reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .	0.1266368532561716
This was the opening statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years .	0.027619022492376844
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer .	9.337587919698558
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission .	6.35414910140481
The Commission , in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission .	0.03435053378712546
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States .	9.86642708929482
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built .	20.491508841847264
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties .	8.27421336739422
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions .	9.207867910014297
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate .	5.8203798330234475
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate , regardless of its population .	0.3575401834346937
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country .	8.052602254029312
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission .	4.077407736581006
Undoubtedly , reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer .	0.7153348450083766
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States .	5.834416301715918
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at European Union level .	0.05706267455278249
At present , under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome , decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity .	0.009009915931327762
I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union .	0.20736994354735372
I support the enlargement of the European Union .	9.580121773246276
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner .	10.082352350140777
However , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties .	0.4275392406605972
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed .	0.45764261831000197
Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members .	0.012745656013468994
President of the Commission , a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans .	0.11295887811157608
This is true , if we think of Russia ' s plans in the thirties , but at the start of your mandate , a few months ago , you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would , however , be presenting a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today .	0.001497814372542455
So , whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme , the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions , or rather a list of issues on the table .	0.05500955012743566
It does not , however , give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points , but that it is just doing the European Commission ' s duty .	0.012559389086340798
In this House , in the past , large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union .	0.0005670209374352338
In this case , Mr Prodi , we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments " : a whole raft of issues are listed , but if I may say so , we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points .	0.006070576610547706
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary " activities .	4.625697631737658
We should be careful , though , Mr Prodi , because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand .	0.003579738009018976
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission , not believing itself to be equal to the task , wishes , or proposes to shed , for example , its powers to implement common policies , which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty .	0.000216627725842502
What do we expect from a government in any case ?	1.8293857663976525
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?	0.002410164944554942
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs , as has been the case in the past .	0.4452871129645897
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu , but with more unsatisfactory implications , restricting the Commission , so you say , to the task of drawing up a few White Papers , as you proposed .	0.000566799734732474
My fear - even if you shake your head , Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers .	0.09789006895083735
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years , we federalists are convinced , we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard .	0.23647321815260364
The reform is important but , if it aggravates the situation , reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission , then the structure of European integration , as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission , will be at risk .	0.0010353445655346676
As for the other points , Mr Prodi , I will take economic and social policy as an example : the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve , but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past , without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective .	0.16064338265785819
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far , I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do .	0.4305570931193486
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself , without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient , and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC .	0.115367848922071
Mr Prodi , there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members , regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government .	0.0071120257013435354
We approve of your position on this : you did well not to isolate that country any further .	0.10371501663232398
In any case , we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action .	0.13478077260324364
Mr Prodi , I repeat that this is , in our opinion , a slightly short-sighted view .	2.5353768194156354e-05
Above all , it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned , for example , as regards the Balkans .	6.65694796783359e-05
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process , disregarding the fact that Croatia , Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all ?	0.0734342088609056
Madam President , Mr Prodi , I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union ' s activities and ask why , then , you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation .	0.001848762830906643
I remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago .	13.471252167179053
Like yourself , he promised "less and better " , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse " , and I do not believe that you , either , can deliver the goods you promise .	0.0004789596662888382
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .	27.268004663714965
The legislative programme is , in fact , a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which , Mr Prodi , you are to take influence away from the people , even on social questions .	0.0008364372427309587
You talk about greater transparency , but produce proposals which would lead to documents which , at present , are available for public inspection being locked away .	0.0015760051030687082
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced .	6.496299831578657
Local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in Brussels .	0.057225548476878565
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy .	0.11461847351083383
Otherwise , the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing .	0.08139280921199427
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments , and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which , as debated by the Polish parliament , fill 140 000 sides of paper .	0.01641897613308353
Even by this stage , that is already too many by far .	0.028316887393084977
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people , the regions and the Member States .	0.11099508058441954
The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively .	6.603711501014024
What is more , the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process , now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them .	0.04375356238916858
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell ' Alba ' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of .	8.758929390682823
Take a look at Jean Monet ' s memoirs .	15.921787507785712
What he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secretariat .	0.026137155031554362
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today .	15.813089860702297
Madam President , this morning the Commission President , Mr Prodi , has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years , laudable aims indeed , to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world : succeeding with enlargement , meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe , introducing better principles of governance .	0.000205116856158289
We accept that Europeans , particularly the younger generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead .	0.025999898144452346
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high ?	2.384153037488929
We need to match this vision with reality .	29.249645906814198
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute .	21.410971095951297
Firstly , we need a successful European economy .	0.008096848138920813
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe , confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation , encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet , show that e-Europe is a good initiative .	0.021582351821850372
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation , stifling individual initiative and enterprise .	0.19336007860766577
We must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society .	0.28026347577509375
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement .	0.07981680716892481
Secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .	0.08852909356086638
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too .	9.362867542046338
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .	9.035642486175647
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .	0.8764403618900369
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .	7.219276218198003
Lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .	0.004267333715310468
Yes , the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament .	0.04709226609738117
The information problem , which Mr Bonde just referred to , is treated like a straw in the wind , with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us , as citizens and as parliamentarians , although we have the right to it under the Treaties .	0.0016544458253830406
The Commission is not in fact today a European government .	21.657480825963876
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament .	17.954573723267714
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe .	8.04909131788251
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union , has its relevant role to play .	0.49729240565450517
Therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens .	0.42282678925023914
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union , from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy ; even to the response by the 14 , the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria .	0.001750218505658732
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .	11.893171028026035
Nonetheless , I agree with you , Mr President of the Commission , that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which , to put it mildly , have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent .	0.016366178183313235
That does not apply to Austria alone .	34.110022247800906
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria .	4.636946464405247
However , the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and , in the final analysis , represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens .	0.027094297134111663
When it comes down to it , Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough .	0.16999755763964008
In this sense , the Commission must insist , and I should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding , enforceable rights .	0.001911806464828502
In this sense , the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers .	0.04386924641119942
Only reasonable , feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational , misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right .	0.008137873312063832
But , and I would like to stress this , this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment , marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European , nationalistic actions and reactions .	0.011674596109537182
In this respect , Mr President of the Commission , I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population .	0.04661545950767034
The feeling of being at the mercy of others , of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote , as in the European elections and , in the worst case scenario , to extremist voting patterns .	0.020681581487408788
The Union , like everyone else , has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation .	0.038943044944627275
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house .	6.905644413454334
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and , significantly , the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture ; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens , who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances .	0.05878257974107757
In this respect , what the Commission says about boosting Europe ' s voice is important .	0.07634352635794513
You yourself , Mr President , spoke of a model of which , unfortunately , there is little mention in the document .	9.328207878951131e-06
You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic , social , cultural and ecological development , both internally and towards the outside world , which differs from other models , including the US model .	0.0006064894869278707
In this sense , the USA is not only our partner ; it is also our competitor ; not our opponent , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .	0.0036408187674369535
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents .	10.306587589204023
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission , and perhaps of the Union itself .	0.017641408746452644
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks" .	11.48006794737989
That , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation .	0.0047571167120739515
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date , or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level .	0.2815382415429552
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government .	0.3141625600428134
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers .	0.9287493631871131
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde , that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only .	0.10470781542693743
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes , which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality , are devolved and repealed .	0.0826054534875274
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament .	0.042281493835027294
Madam President , you spoke about fundamental political values , and one of the fundamental political values , even more important than democracy , is respect for others .	0.0001738674314445785
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism .	4.8776020083825555
Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong , but also listening to their explanations .	0.2055676819640407
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution , that is , it must not entail more risks .	0.022836318957531687
The applicant countries ' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens , who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works , as it is not resolving the most serious problems .	0.12119684882978639
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania , reaching as far as Belgrade , but above all , the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues .	0.12413576332402129
Even today , we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics .	0.07979706991950214
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions , with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur .	0.17267225623851293
I would also like to say a few words on Africa , Madam President .	0.03659817220053175
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children .	0.027661214752773517
Europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases .	0.0008587407721531362
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation .	23.013608153731326
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm .	0.5384806495899193
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few .	3.705008432587644
As for the Internet , Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules .	0.2234250857599933
On a personal note , please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who , by acting the way they are , are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated .	0.019332716891026218
We live in a world of rules and regulations : let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future .	0.3382468446460033
Madam President , as a Padanian taxpayer , I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy , Mr Prodi , since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well .	0.0013779494474135741
Listening to him just now , I was concerned when he mentioned new resources , something that readily translates as additional taxation , in view , inter alia , of enlargement , that is the entry of new States into the Union .	8.717083054278904e-05
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?	1.6555055367421643
My Padanian electorate who , thanks to Mr Prodi , have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention , thanks once again to Mr Prodi , of paying another tax for someone else .	0.009373388906460793
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Members of the Commission , five months after its coming into office , the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union .	0.0007864462375090861
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic .	19.59241825121627
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe " ?	2.5571210277562253
Moreover , Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States .	0.12960871286454043
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe , no less ?	0.005301150579707731
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about .	14.955491134316834
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration " imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power ?	1.8704650667944431
According to the Commission , external policy can succeed , provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge ! So who is this then ?	0.00553903254522261
The Commission as a whole , its President perhaps , the Council ?	5.1818107528257454e-05
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions , while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks .	0.3823243177107362
We could not agree more with the latter .	15.219371151000876
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .	4.390139246354294
The document mentions common values on different occasions .	17.05618872999768
Unfortunately , I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking .	0.07281297086780314
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on .	6.684389841943464
I am convinced that the Bible , God ' s word , is the only pure source of proper standards and real values .	0.014911323046230447
In the tradition of our continent , this realisation is an important one which merits recognition .	0.12910661353764916
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?	0.00031253091016982063
Have you already included your second term of office ?	1.515715799268207
But seriously .	1.0
As it enlarges , the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation .	0.08609663632528756
First , streamlining .	0.00018163761489316051
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning .	9.39756172825774
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy .	10.319885228131357
In other words , a social , ecologically-orientated market , a secure currency , guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally .	5.991193476494371e-05
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important .	0.6270991629401468
Secondly , the new "in " word is flexibility .	0.019199713258411757
However , increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation .	0.06978444224471382
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States .	5.028545613950501
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .	0.08774912737848901
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers .	8.060653565703241
(Applause ) Transparency does not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizens , transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg , when and with what right .	0.013992621666780251
That is transparency .	191.93154808051537
Thirdly , the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .	0.0397908531163132
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join , but by how many countries it can accommodate .	0.1678372447646022
(Applause ) If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union , then it must not be paid .	0.3910012834334856
It is too high a price , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union .	0.39475378770916114
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone .	6.925266364719882
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies .	7.376112739927599
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .	0.1161337914378333
Not only the Commission , not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together .	0.8705616293609741
In doing so , we need , no less , to reinvent the European Union , but without destroying the present Union .	1.2728318085611352e-05
(Applause ) Madam President , in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement .	0.1060739171007228
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible .	5.078288486066326
On the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down .	0.3050090003811845
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union , in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring .	0.7913066921850374
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC .	11.37404216445622
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice .	31.872751575624363
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors , for example .	0.06817104482161063
In this way , a decision-making system can be created that is more effective , clearer , more open and more democratic .	0.0005255097843344272
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation .	7.115906311730963
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , your inspiring speech , Mr Prodi , has quite won me over .	1.6004873570218758e-06
It raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .	0.03619229363152931
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying , about the difference between words and deeds .	0.14455695355296472
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace , security and stability .	0.11805588792566514
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries , as well as European opinion .	0.09650830079434887
But these days , we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes .	0.07117142945559193
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet , even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high .	0.22352446958093825
We need to make our citizens feel at home , according to Mr Swoboda , and I agree .	0.0034387133722569843
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility .	7.027800875041118
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam , namely subsidiarity .	0.06836018455593929
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .	0.5892440604583077
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .	0.47185450384514843
That will require a new political culture , not only in words , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions .	0.0045477130356825525
Regions which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some Member States .	0.0005107211249662405
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally , but also vertically , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community .	0.05135792583120308
This is what the Commission will be judged on .	28.82154977307385
Madam President , the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005 .	0.007956364748141065
These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict .	7.626604437018358
So , in the first part on the new forms of European governance , the words 'federalism ' and 'superstate ' are not mentioned at all .	0.018378663028025006
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole .	4.7722814291167
In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society , all of which are described , with no form of hierarchy , as 'integral elements of European governance ' .	0.028446275557331615
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings , primarily about our values .	0.03307761025522431
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat .	16.80346265246486
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main .	0.11753591505193263
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory .	20.15355104218081
In this theory , on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations , new policies or new , restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights .	0.007024008878851293
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights .	10.341514803050423
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different .	9.002706905524219
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations .	12.45007986706447
This is not impossible .	149.5744541380524
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet .	5.3056206564079105
Instead , we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations .	0.20333423003358633
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication , Mr Prodi , but which is unfortunately not there .	0.028504043555702175
Madam President , Mr Prodi , you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element : confidence .	0.00021985944902831788
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this .	6.338026378879255
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption ?	2.025168339911638
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty , insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency .	0.5534179546997466
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders .	13.976514873801024
Consequently , you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration .	0.22725929852055554
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials .	8.326086344939357
The Member States , local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above , all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels .	0.02875403494004525
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people .	5.7517274836960315
Clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .	0.04539100855462713
You dare not even call a spade a spade , but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance ' for what is nothing more than federal , autocratic , centralised government .	0.007876420959735914
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty , you are now revealing your ultimate goal .	0.20949385578543822
You intend to trade in all European sovereignty , whether national or collective , for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position .	0.04120100448760011
Finally , you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians , or are allowing this to happen , just because the result does not suit you .	0.008242243288182861
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades .	7.078073051728239
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schssel which , quite obviously , is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre .	0.042966635773166235
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because , as you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax .	0.009110250766391423
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union .	3.9429010751736095
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .	9.913834692976161
The governments which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you are also responsible .	0.0014636741801517573
Brussels is not all of us , as you claim .	0.01987172125495896
It is all of you .	33.80059087668189
Tell the truth for once .	42.73844859389754
You could not care less what the people of Europe want .	15.514097462940867
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement .	10.318388216167776
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism .	4.878677971692322
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship .	11.571301417489304
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship .	13.096316218684015
We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects .	15.465848623641923
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states .	13.754634641811492
Europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe .	11.134583503545821
(Limited applause ) President Prodi , today you have presented the Commission ' s five-year programme , and it has many objectives that we endorse .	0.01939633129653397
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues , and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues .	0.441117636116746
In my view , Mr Prodi , judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us , one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance , and that is solidarity , not so much at international level as at internal level .	0.0033119725497067244
The Archbishop of Milan , Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini , is calling upon all politicians , in particular those like you and me , President Prodi , for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics , to reconsider a development process , which , in addition to economic profit , takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account .	0.0008463018018033021
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up , one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone .	1.0705814774195368
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model , one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public , the most natural instruments for building solidarity .	0.02147122724047373
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced .	0.2679395262707973
This social freedom , which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor , gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability .	0.017994971776630564
Mr President , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .	0.01070907645178373
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual , without forgetting , naturally , that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business , to invest and risk , and in an ordered and focused system , entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity .	0.002924191290412004
In the age of globalisation , which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers , the European Commission cannot forget solidarity , and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man ' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man .	0.08320119837439573
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .	15.481069115849198
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice .	8.867809628741766
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , 'Shaping the new Europe ' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all .	0.008589697761511217
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries , but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union .	0.27020006056119644
What sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five-year programme ?	0.003069221042932376
My reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously .	0.15046647654463213
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation .	7.885571797870495
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest .	5.869197895504204
Consequently , we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom .	0.10175595221411204
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document .	6.265635071550278
However , there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work .	0.1335635678816621
The first concerns women , gender and women's rights .	0.023225035478951838
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth .	9.714629644326301
That is important , but equality is not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our societies more democratic .	0.008678244999223709
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality' , 'gender ' and 'women ' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe' .	0.2431668664791037
You mentioned 'women ' in your speech , but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals .	0.24142758678614842
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women ?	3.185433145298252
What other explanation could there be for omitting women ?	1.6245034683720712
The EU must not take on a masculine persona .	19.298602136581508
My other question concerns Africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe' .	0.11579329009547738
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic .	0.12359211597904966
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job , but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent , partly by including it among its strategic goals .	0.1678072581695733
Finally , I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets .	0.8332821545967583
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect .	15.367993157635416
Madam President , President of the Commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe .	0.0012887476331799727
However , out of all the points , two specifically require our attention , and they are closely linked : peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe .	0.0003496814678856386
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority .	12.252232926491232
For some time , we have all agreed on this notion , but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement , even if this comes at a price .	0.009054891023613497
Today , we have been called on to choose , for the forthcoming decades , between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy , but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring .	0.016232082465925425
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in constitutional reform , providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government .	0.11361569344659739
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself , if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union .	0.6796649320214381
Moreover , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded .	0.5488244497220596
Without these prospects that we have outlined , Europe would , once again , have no future .	3.2893740438247965e-05
Madam President , Mr Prodi , we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome .	0.011933169419784907
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century .	7.811653058007985
This event must underpin enlargement .	52.098744718389625
Rather than using the word 'enlargement ' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance .	0.1839422176941021
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks .	11.215967766479997
This is one of the goals of your reform .	23.83900323982144
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .	11.401426760659774
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence .	5.841598827964765
However , saying is one thing and doing is another ! You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers .	0.3737371494181098
I will therefore judge you on your deeds .	23.437059261634513
In the meantime , I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication .	0.07657576579889298
However , I must make two essential points .	0.011572527479322437
These concern the simplification and application of Community law .	12.072297902466074
In 1998 , 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed .	0.2198223839166681
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .	13.394038604647607
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic .	12.949896904930343
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this .	6.2050436955484845
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us , including unemployment .	0.2724122705163181
Nevertheless , I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed .	0.06548890420298123
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .	7.140798188393042
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health .	0.3984286103274727
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication .	13.698832735550791
Finally , you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future .	0.11616739490573157
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .	8.582595802893458
Also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .	0.2341948668084868
If you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthening liaison with this House , as we are the representatives of the citizens .	0.017248837496138297
Madam President , we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning .	0.02629307553935207
In the two documents , strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and , to this end , to introduce a new agenda for the Commission , establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment , through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States , and , primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation .	0.013038702632226031
To this end , I shall confine myself to stressing , out of all the choices available , the importance of three priority decisions which should , in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union , be the basis for both the Commission ' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months .	0.008784721509688538
Firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the European Investment Bank .	0.1039312444589294
Secondly , the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research , innovation and training .	0.09977171457193997
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature , resulting from investments in continuous training , refresher courses , adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives , that are always debatable , regarding new employment or employment cuts .	0.01524771684335288
If , among other things , as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well , the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue , focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge , in other words , a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules , this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes .	0.005124595914405099
Thirdly , I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population , owing to the ageing of the population , is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union .	0.007168296032015237
This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration , but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market , and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems , certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people ' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life .	0.2122691004324891
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , you have come here today , Mr Prodi , in a very reformist and ambitious mood .	2.164479267080272e-05
I welcome you and your ambition .	39.76424518639826
Ambition will be needed , given the mammoth task which awaits us .	0.045498947472868326
In order to make these reforms , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strengths of the reformer himself , but also of the opinions of others .	0.0012422624458656958
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission , but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice .	0.5229184842382468
We have 1.27% of the Community ' s GDP .	0.08345221663860136
Not a euro more or a euro less .	19.592418926709126
It will not be us who refuse these new resources .	15.290175493471994
You should ask the Council .	21.184944820875238
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre .	15.92178516023028
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget .	0.09179071030427047
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE-DE , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .	0.013493034659773613
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs . Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system .	0.6890275130113264
It is all very well for us , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resources , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved .	0.006062990759914386
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them .	12.977415623656038
Madam President , the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever .	0.03165173151380539
On one hand , there are the words and , on the other , their real political meaning .	6.834046196447064e-05
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty .	11.774829478595347
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled ?	2.1460512452092964
What is meant by the Commission ' s declared objective of 'economic reform ' in the labour market ?	2.8103569678674485
Does this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed-term contracts ?	0.00267666637809626
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth .	7.975972242888246
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .	9.889865933581667
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment .	8.659098071530579
The ingredients of this policy are well known .	18.280336413098855
They are the stimulation of public and private investment , increased investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise .	0.029081323560950608
In this respect , the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed .	0.023761304618302947
In the world of new technologies , the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are .	0.21300699838018472
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era .	10.155556488897545
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion .	0.017349206267904774
We are asking workers to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone .	0.01922604815512903
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets , yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity .	0.677419075016274
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry , having lost the gamble of a take-over , leave with compensation of EUR 30 million ?	0.12901135488620843
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised .	11.499435102272045
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions , leading inevitably to monopoly situations .	0.27164569376619907
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15% , 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term .	0.2863321431473296
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .	7.1353203429260965
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets .	6.29904917664873
To conclude , the next five years will be crucial .	0.003310477766349046
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people .	7.727222141127379
We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner .	11.09463736260817
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses .	1.1238091104420542e-05
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one .	9.288191225063086
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy .	13.49070072373117
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .	0.23234547252783358
And do you know why ?	1.2599210112247845
Just look at transport policy ; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries .	0.3898395955985337
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say , although of course he has no obligation to do so .	0.32461195588275943
Let me give you three examples .	34.661921766904975
First : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways .	0.27058321049699097
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .	9.099151968895665
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .	10.560706743616104
The same applies to European air traffic control .	22.161461892296188
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic , but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment .	0.1075659977808985
You still have not finished that agenda .	24.13458921928144
Commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .	0.07434656276895972
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community .	12.497759273488848
If we fail to complete it , citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement .	0.10593317050151206
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .	5.634787510061908
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .	9.16606661318047
Mr President of the Commission , if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions , then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people .	0.10099691758766727
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage .	0.003906380930635202
From that standpoint , it is useful that the Commission ' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000 , the common agricultural policy , which includes fishing , and secondly , the activities of the structural funds .	0.0006816088055486133
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000 .	6.557823747059863
The Agenda 2000 issues are , of course , ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives , the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life .	0.0023157884648756072
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major , high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy .	0.5333829581115149
I do not necessarily mean financial resources .	39.35272622149982
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money .	9.168481316065536
There must also be savings .	78.9091072818529
But what we need is the analytical resources : these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital .	0.1918464989786347
This is because it is essential to achieve two things : the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured , and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products , mainly to the benefit of developing countries .	0.03839206172012925
It is not easy to combine those aims .	29.793858827893583
There is no obvious way .	88.86190526343196
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them .	7.259710223141155
As regards the other aspect of Agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievements to point to , but there are still less developed regions , particularly island regions , to which more attention should be paid .	0.0015187121453764541
As for fishing , there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds , which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish , will certainly prove fruitful in the future .	0.02183525090276315
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse .	8.799893712934573
Madam President , I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan .	0.12918152066583935
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present .	8.419835499148247
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group , Mr Poettering , in his opening address .	0.005467674141577547
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place .	5.476113471758667
That foundation is clearly the single market .	15.151925112450183
How strongly is the single market established at the moment ?	2.4127158811875096
I want to remind Mr Prodi , and his colleagues who are still here , of the findings of the Commission ' s own survey among 3000 European businesses .	0.03953518548449684
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications .	5.394169798756631
This is the Commission ' s own survey .	46.32774404471988
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry .	8.215783748639707
The Commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market .	6.476103117843658
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .	0.01650702136558647
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved .	8.920085879520599
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union .	6.22646836251744
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement .	10.89861322434967
I conclude by saying , on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task .	1.0161580205693725
Madam President , Mr Prodi , ladies and gentlemen , at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today .	0.0004161623126125485
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme .	10.64131086903726
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance , which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens .	0.30613336823826337
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate , if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority .	0.457071476812132
The interlinking of the EU institutions , the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well .	0.24788643623916398
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction ?	2.015095159659518
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what ' but more 'what are we doing together ' ?	2.475961860403078
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens .	8.954933031498186
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us .	10.339809158725684
I would add to these the future of our social model .	13.452201642841837
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .	6.061818692267018
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history .	7.639947571171385
Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based , both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire , but not under just any conditions .	0.09563520717074471
Our people expect more Europe , but not just any Europe .	0.03599604834074762
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather , on the basis of our social model , to be able to organise globalisation .	0.02017049032593906
In this respect I must say that , in terms of your commitment to a political union , to which we are favourable , this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model , on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world .	0.012831542191682612
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I should like to start with a quote : "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme .	0.003509452070131477
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration .	11.789211438808627
It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime " .	8.155471042704667
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security , freedom , citizens ' rights and judicial cooperation .	0.024857974316084455
A paper this short is a farce .	22.345604235846
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand .	6.594921037169467
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard .	14.569838419886926
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it ; we need a basis for a scoreboard .	0.2876639351275571
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .	6.4719886049567465
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly , and those who are not fleeing know where they stand .	0.446027332664509
We want instruments to prevent abuse .	34.66192178261518
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States ' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL , for example , so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime .	0.1413732781442241
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission , even where it is merely submitting a paper .	0.359030899132866
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation , on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group .	0.002614302777022699
This is not the case in other areas , as has already been pointed out .	0.0753057295465795
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards , common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind .	0.08763219751385228
This aim is that trade should benefit development , and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world ' s most dynamic and competitive regions .	0.6742553668181619
On the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?	0.006756062347312578
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation , in other words , increased wealth , but when we look at how this wealth is distributed , we see , unfortunately , that the gulf between the world ' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase .	0.002053860934813886
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve ?	0.10457502493505834
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works , if they cause trade to increase on the one hand , but on the other , they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow ?	0.03350380456088068
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones .	9.244360604262873
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .	10.963894099991425
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights , environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations .	0.31615915351999635
Most importantly though , we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform , not just of the WTO but also of the ILO , the United Nations and above all , of the financial institutions , specifically the IMF and the World Bank .	0.0012963810246762147
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation .	13.885575880592912
We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process , so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries , but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world .	0.12204928459184465
Madam President , I would also like to welcome the Commission ' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years , although I hope that it intends , in subsequent documents , to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today .	0.016154977203000236
Having said this , Madam President , I am prepared , once again , to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy .	0.0003778066126855747
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .	0.7366116944151052
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years .	8.213620333948526
However , it seems that the Commission does not share this view , although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001 , and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification .	0.22997786725217695
In fact , the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions , such as the European Parliament , which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy .	0.010069802878068659
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply .	9.663843612434595
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process .	5.1938213151957235
Therefore , Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I would ask that this issue , which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union , be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years .	0.0011137621962559964
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme .	0.02131613903317768
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens .	0.09292478696135442
I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .	0.06651350606630832
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured .	14.457623869745788
After all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?	0.0017236222943905976
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .	7.98105322271072
This is a key priority for us to focus on .	16.491594253576338
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy .	0.576535638988404
Yes , e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .	0.279049895505905
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses .	6.635215952997009
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit .	11.015592243031591
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union .	5.611377445603724
Again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .	0.17012036724798166
You said in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs .	5.2215227718873e-05
I very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for granted .	0.1036340880293966
There is still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that .	0.09332952754451877
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .	8.988161807257091
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme .	0.0050699641956079775
To me , this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle .	0.14909393789409042
Unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission .	0.16120633604136927
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group , I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission .	0.24858239199145
The Commission gives no soul to Europe .	21.96612523264346
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe .	0.4202252805983427
Just a few main points .	49.166738539358086
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs .	0.3801008237014223
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas , about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning .	0.7333678408247324
Mr President of the Commission , it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe .	0.12844501778326092
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens .	5.532313391840591
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme .	13.72546087570736
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .	0.09183261220842093
Declarations of principle are not enough .	21.598374088749015
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described .	8.884246406187021
Madam President , Mr Prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your benchmark be , if you had to make direct choices ?	0.00010027932228416216
You have the fine , charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections , or rather the turnout at the next European elections .	0.1222644786416155
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constituents , not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House , but on the street , then I ask myself , what can I say ?	0.0005561865090645168
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what is there that is new ?	2.2852809911598146e-05
There is nothing new in your work programme .	19.106143221600213
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year ' s work programme .	7.444027555177997
Does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?	1.6208517867461127
No , it does not ! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .	0.14834888400721546
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas .	10.90301277906329
Have you done so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?	0.00041741381854536793
No , you have not done so .	0.0051238911905749215
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement .	0.2992013418301967
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .	0.04496487326409268
You have not integrated it anywhere .	37.79908514159472
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure .	10.043208359660085
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure ; no , Mr Prodi , we need , at long last , to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored .	0.0014604083896871867
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation .	7.0175830247522315
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .	0.00876383220757482
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world .	9.4999616333968
Where it falls short , what is missing , is transposition in the Member States and monitoring .	0.004281954633698263
It is time you took your job seriously , it is time for you , as President of the Commission , to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties .	0.015606193295327751
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day ' s work to be done .	7.390420015123795
That is what we expect of you in the next five years .	10.430973362219786
.	1.0
(ES ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , as chairman of this Parliament ' s Committee on Fisheries , Mr Prodi , you are not making things easy for me at all .	0.0007927296208206488
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us .	6.468626799234513
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change .	8.17136914549256
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , is deafening .	0.003389713309716469
Not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the CFP .	0.002604294019230939
I am not asking for details or specific points , but I believe that a mention was required .	0.1945845259588741
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?	0.003999601390904575
This is all the more serious , if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission , Mr Prodi , has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy , which you are legally required to do in 2002 .	0.01432651270115785
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?	2.153584573164523
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe , and their families , and the fishing industries , both the extractive and processing and marketing industries , and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports , in so many European regions , in most cases peripheral regions , who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority ?	0.001292661179904272
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years , but you have not done so for the CFP , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation .	0.08173073466453816
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .	8.143886883200041
I would therefore ask you , Mr Prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today .	0.004733771788063929
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .	7.917465569891578
Mr President of the Commission , this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament , a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission .	0.007848065899980224
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform .	0.16142130769292984
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission .	0.04862518667335459
We consider it to be of utmost importance that , in terms of financial control , personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts , we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy , for the benefit of the citizen .	0.003986783467883767
At the same time , we are aware that this is a massive programme and that , during the overhaul in the next couple of years , it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in , as before .	0.002700825096774212
Much like in the Netherlands , where , at a given point , women woke up to the fact that , by referring to European legislation , they could improve their status in terms of social security , this is now also the case for scores of other citizens .	0.0006257479596505407
They want to see results .	79.53933564655708
Democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to results , citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on .	0.02184254060359482
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security .	0.004392527646005094
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas .	6.553070360473044
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level .	7.739374120260106
This gives the citizen a sense of recognition , here in Europe and elsewhere .	0.08649115279181954
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions , such as education and health care .	0.23471719896860366
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity .	19.051571515136594
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-read the Commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .	0.013405203128516278
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament , but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it .	0.24854324018531518
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union ' s regional policy .	0.3186582277446571
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement .	14.399100228713529
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?	2.932194968905074
Certainly not ! At the same time , it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries , and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty .	0.057846171026694045
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .	11.903233364572463
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .	12.829733174119763
It plays down one of the Treaties ' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions ' policies and measures .	8.335770289058074
It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others .	9.961452650652301
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right .	12.686953511572941
Unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk .	0.12896492070671495
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union , for which the Commission is responsible .	0.3129493251449957
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100 , the ten so-called "strongest " regions reached an average of 158 , and the ten so-called "weakest " regions reached a figure of around 50 .	0.11046301865926897
You may draw your own conclusions .	31.785123447013785
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region , the Azores , one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral .	0.015953000329536855
I am waiting for the Commission ' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions , which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999 .	0.36734221928119415
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only disunity .	0.009468805867364923
Madam President , Mr Prodi , Europe needs a strong Commission .	1.5121763633527305e-05
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people , the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement .	0.6773256599565187
We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament .	9.393852253725132
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating .	11.627547242538014
You must therefore listen to our opinions , one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech .	0.2778936971479332
Firstly , Mr President , although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency , it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction .	0.016064510341157523
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .	0.13544244028046779
You must go further , towards reconciling the people with Europe , in particular those people who are falling victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological divisions .	1.7334163207460788e-05
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition .	7.380004509833057
The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health , education , transport , communications , water and whatever else .	0.00041937577083708333
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed .	0.007447301991908948
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services .	9.37940815870884
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jrg Haider .	8.0600277152854
Madam President , the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities .	0.02128028163228576
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .	0.023317879278336718
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens .	5.740401789659022
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000 .	0.3621688140697353
However , I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper .	0.4294465499367373
In its present form , what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision - and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration , which has already established credibility in this particular field .	0.22077856639636723
Furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland .	0.05296035255001139
This body , for example , alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , is already doing good work .	0.00019647914864740298
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation .	8.649161074278881
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another .	0.4131060510758813
That is something we must guard against .	27.416182489092648
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .	0.03917829397839456
We will be looking for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year .	0.27909371339787253
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be applying a number of tests .	0.35009512744791066
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy , employment policy and social policy .	0.29876482364054757
At the moment , social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy .	0.04837823532499406
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency .	4.621076919496796
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect .	10.923289348302161
The spate of mergers , takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive .	0.4029400617708189
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .	6.329691764643065
That is the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place .	0.3413009937327273
Finally , with the emergence , the resurgence , of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination , and Article 137 to combat exclusion .	0.005811921943261579
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .	17.13727683112966
The aspirations are fine , President Prodi , we want those aspirations to be matched by action .	0.0016010715334827124
Madam President , I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot .	0.1651272691033327
Mr Prodi , you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe .	0.04646978709357399
However , for the economic sector which I represent , i.e . fisheries , this means change .	1.9479387186456607e-06
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility .	8.871453749948403
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry .	7.653790260283004
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing .	7.314100020709034
However , I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor , which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe .	0.183146232436532
Plus , this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act , which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too .	0.1233593037166057
This has since been unanimously approved .	36.46396503800311
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time , i.e . at the beginning of the year 2000 .	0.00481009243433118
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper .	8.306540909610584
I hope that this is a misunderstanding .	71.50738395785692
Please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promises .	0.00034567142538115676
Madam President , many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission ' s statement .	0.13953444818065214
However , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission .	0.10704543070510018
One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in Europe .	0.009892539000322784
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important .	7.885521417590191
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity .	8.694310257803703
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other , both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe .	0.2930864971131119
Unless we address these issues , unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes , unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe , we will fail .	0.033648555216298406
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day .	6.950341815115981
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand .	0.12765987331132672
If we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .	0.13832616901111897
Thank you , Mr De Rossa .	0.00039771798447838305
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission , I must tell you that I have received , pursuant to Rule 37 , seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate .	0.00848808911483907
Welcome I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait , led by His Excellency , Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah , Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister , here in the official gallery .	0.0036836561099000084
On behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament .	0.07445042693769449
Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible .	0.4201188601880353
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative .	5.291288805424791
On the same day , I understand , Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead .	0.0023196344065779845
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements .	9.191909907108364
However , the appointment was cancelled at the last minute .	0.028157732672234537
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .	16.433990300189574
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received .	5.700028071723052
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute ?	2.0977044772528246
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard ?	2.519786100957577
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again ?	2.00003643213967
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible ?	2.02270604665115
Finally , will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ?	0.006203428935554403
Without them we would not be able to function .	26.864476809573432
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .	0.0043564693422070136
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament , outside the doors of the Hemicycle , to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate ?	0.041586828371337516
If there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?	0.06747882204079379
Mr President , I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants , which we have always considered to be a priority , and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , Mr Barn Crespo , we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors .	0.014373542826870275
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway .	13.439748560299902
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise .	6.297781192456005
Mr President , first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants .	0.08223089718810295
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament .	4.55549533865259
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament .	5.002004438130939
To give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons .	0.16957174384836293
Following a letter I received yesterday , I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month .	0.10735333831901582
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament .	6.967512634141141
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament , in which the assistants were informed of this .	0.008453733505309412
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday , so they were fully aware of the decision .	0.5651314010578528
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel , there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session .	0.3639923105565619
But there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission .	0.19696238256437193
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee .	9.312698693133871
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever .	0.19372880889656893
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants .	7.909584282325327
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .	2.2462016446842206e-05
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .	9.860837148971635
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .	0.016142999407225803
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours .	0.12041928895304393
We shall now proceed to the vote.1 VOTE Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party , the delegation of the Spanish People ' s Party , with regard to Mrs Terrn i Cus ' s resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice .	0.006832254512849001
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People ' s Party , and we have voted in favour of the Terrn i Cus resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent .	0.14183017056981492
However , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .	0.009093063945032193
On the other hand , we have voted in favour of Recital J which , in fact , is in line with what I , as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms , proposed to that Committee , with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference .	0.0004798201788157241
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13 .	22.7956232504553
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People ' s Party has been advocating for some time .	4.99284910796606
For similar reasons , we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which , with the oral amendment , dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity , since political rights , not just voting in local elections , but political rights in general terms , form part of the sovereignty of Member States .	0.0006740866924067456
Given the oral amendment , we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done .	0.21572980952726428
.	1.0
(DA ) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution , but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect .	1.269463383535369
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation ' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe .	6.87397229630969
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants .	4.1177584990400495
In terms of human rights , this is a backward step .	0.016257484268787738
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .	5.9366696947892645
Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium .	6.224297583552133
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status , whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution .	0.17264443210008112
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators , even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025 .	0.7621549914767757
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections .	7.303114904217767
Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice .	9.267138390301811
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000 ) Mr President , I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties , which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission .	0.1329495572845198
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions : firstly , that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore , far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period , the funding of this project should be increased .	0.01946582283969839
This should be done , for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting , in URBAN projects , that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose .	0.042203015721853504
Secondly , when deciding which areas must be subsidised , we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects .	0.004564293730431852
Disparate actions are not effective .	47.18707540029101
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy , in accordance with the objectives set , that is to say , the social , economic , environmental and democratic management dimensions , as well as the relationship between them .	0.00023296085669807456
Thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes , as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question .	0.044325979038221684
Finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institutions which are closest to the citizens , that is , the local councils and bodies .	2.3161020508562592e-05
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs .	19.59241893505919
They have more involvement in the problems and , furthermore , they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy , and thereby achieve better results .	0.007365016719648437
Lastly , in today ' s vote on our four amendments , two have been approved and the other two rejected .	0.009708753305775555
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate , to URBAN projects , that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes .	0.15834495784699695
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas .	0.0066020161887103065
As the smallest Community initiative in existence , we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected .	0.25619480227662306
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects .	5.459438935590788
We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established .	6.575605224287873
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place .	8.70356470572297
It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy ' .	6.40907872037746
Finally , there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union .	0.04294676846292314
Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy .	7.51879588693744
Mr President , I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development , known as URBAN .	0.006900001817151145
As with all other Community initiatives , this is very positive .	0.020126876086950574
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State , whichever one it may be .	0.7258598746251651
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay , and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners ' Party .	0.3906843605712082
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .	8.178887810109737
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities .	7.247292702169783
.	1.0
(DA ) The Left ' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+ , the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG , but not URBAN .	0.03219721397904422
At a forthcoming review of these programmes , it ought to be established that the EU ' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU .	0.5625923524056535
.	1.0
(DA ) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN) .	4.875804047494151
Basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .	0.006748567006358253
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences , i.e . increasing unemployment , exclusion and delinquency .	0.0096456496391568
It underlines the fact that , in order to ensure sustainable urban development , an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis , namely the unemployed , immigrants , refugees , women and the socially excluded .	0.00040393707831816304
However , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .	0.12190188217261297
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis .	9.045738944088859
Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work .	13.394025864292532
As the report itself indicates , the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period , which were already low , at EUR 900 million .	0.017223948073493547
Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts , both suburban and inner city , are affected .	0.07943627179876844
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap .	5.733682881789251
- (FR ) Mrs McCarthy , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis , all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .	0.03487161959766383
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area , cities are at the forefront of economic , social and cultural change in Europe .	0.03153993874860992
At the same time , the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas .	0.08541521495948459
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes , high unemployment , substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency .	0.05466025638103286
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved .	6.605859782707918
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds .	6.218152260524531
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable .	13.096316275146167
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .	11.071466437840192
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .	0.14275834811011046
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities , the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration .	0.3795888687981187
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups .	0.4505252562413476
We can therefore welcome its adoption .	39.764245737821994
We must , however , admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory ! The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge .	0.009213844819960381
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period .	6.0233413529246365
This represents a drop of 30% ! This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative .	6.865980595022428
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .	13.754633465771647
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States .	5.566721136528221
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects , the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect .	0.6518304602701219
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters .	7.673517093627524
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social distress taking the form of unemployment , misery and crime .	0.010994909033561729
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency .	19.592416818219746
Faced with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt .	0.1420220878093898
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state , exercising its governing functions , and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately .	0.022139718205731847
The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people .	10.754111549051474
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises , the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way .	0.44621083552436774
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union ' s desire to communitise urban policy .	9.994944028593604
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies .	13.214784192529416
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets .	4.146089864430981
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe .	5.401379172933987
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project .	7.627099335521775
In fact , the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted .	0.04832068322829236
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .	12.342387214851746
Finally , the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities .	0.0931308303652796
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .	7.6200939622629145
On one hand , this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country .	0.24676750431407973
This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs .	9.785617132689147
On the other hand , it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination .	0.05897886530099409
This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful , as shown by the US precedent .	0.26277668647896774
For all these reasons , the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report .	0.14291236140836486
Decourrire report (A5-0028/2000 ) Mr President , the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts .	0.08440651220849645
Like many of my colleagues , I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative .	0.19374981618257003
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium , I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created .	0.2676724446427541
They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive .	6.831758995729262
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development .	9.502932360795835
Why am I stressing this point ?	1.3458996182148268
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .	7.408848571882906
For example , to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union .	0.017142893372352638
This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions , for example .	0.07209251659151239
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU ' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed .	5.600303628866449
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction .	13.503973105942833
We know that some Member States are still wavering , for example , between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees , as in the Aspe valley .	0.005236172337361896
However , I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the A32 .	0.030908779278050566
In this respect too , I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies , specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted .	0.09351103237908945
Mr President , I voted for the Decourrire report on the Community initiative INTERREG , mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers .	0.10710112297770769
I voted for it , not just because I was born in a coastal town , Genoa , but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too .	0.00779459648605921
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East : we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe .	0.5266358040762205
As an MEP from a border region , I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest .	0.11922774134607193
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically , socially and culturally .	0.4625839587776372
Due to the existence of these borders , they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong .	0.2504050429972629
This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy .	9.45261471430876
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990 .	16.649334593998688
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union .	0.534244943613725
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs , education and training , cultural exchanges , action to combat health problems , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunications networks .	7.511987032419892e-05
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration .	7.142497768276907
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted , bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border .	0.7832323070883149
In cross-border cooperation , greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators .	0.5689635327765131
In the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment , the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment .	0.052449135109280495
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing , braking or hindering cross-border mobility .	0.19793920442621796
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region ! INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area .	5.626742205892733
Finally , and in particular , expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG ! The challenges are therefore immense .	0.07007942832310746
The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy ! I hope everyone , like Mr Decourrire , whom I congratulate , will realise this ! - (FR ) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy .	0.08057194424576912
This apparently generous policy , officially intended to help problem regions , is a fool ' s bargain for French taxpayers .	0.01236777354866958
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds .	8.496345541886463
Between 1994 and 1999 , our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006 .	0.003054505063232928
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions .	5.267111957847074
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe .	8.075567528688897
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds .	4.64947653011434
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to Brussels .	0.021215961639889563
The INTERREG initiative , launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations , sits comfortably within this philosophy .	0.04482490378998062
However , Mr Decourrire does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats .	0.15696747026006494
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid .	5.887668088674328
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and , of course , about refusing to use outside service providers .	0.032625919434902534
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission .	9.599712029116398
However , these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted , in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives , particularly INTERREG .	0.0027253270294769817
This is why the National Front voted against the report .	13.714386301723309
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation .	0.32456736295908206
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative .	8.027710407577098
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation .	7.660418500095575
In the Commission guidelines , few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA .	0.07411717696083696
The amendments to the Decourrire report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented .	13.331333706220846
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake .	13.163456117447954
I am aware of the Commission ' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November .	8.077547593224338
However , I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation .	0.4957963495586704
One example of this is the 'Celtic ' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France , Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland .	0.5153590941078712
This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector .	8.401127886042843
It also has excellent cultural and relational links , through twinnings for example .	0.08938230830881569
INTERREG III , strand A , would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer .	0.0473560419026912
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .	8.368311357844384
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry .	4.846326093940873
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation ' of the European Union .	3.307567886539462
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east .	6.409075046495849
The maritime world has great potential .	29.147079273168238
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined .	4.816319281935896
.	1.0
(DA ) The European project began as a partnership between States .	13.865471562962599
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years .	8.745685995311858
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the EU is just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values , competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades .	0.051936089780745154
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition .	21.818336959597758
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community .	7.634497162707262
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .	7.864231032499524
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides .	7.914612870603817
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders , projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale .	0.9507741167156688
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .	15.281095846479147
.	1.0
(FR ) Mr Decourrire ' s report is not without merit : at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions , it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16 .	0.17975113505706372
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet , who is well versed in this matter , have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG , the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously .	0.15170104031946455
Nonetheless , the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations .	0.9591383333317431
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States , as suggested in recital of the report .	0.18974461692282324
We only ask one thing of the Commission : that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories .	0.4107311794105654
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions , especially on the vitality of the more rural , the more remote and the least populated regions , is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure , far from it .	0.011650675493016429
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States .	6.295059351503043
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation ' (p.17 ) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague ' (p.18) .	0.24779941972673458
Calling under these circumstances , as he does in paragraph 20 , for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House .	0.061213827126658224
Lastly , there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrire ' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans : I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual .	0.3140450147586978
It is up to Washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests .	0.008808102451334988
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrire report and will choose to abstain during the final vote .	5.920740787521367
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000 ) Mr President , I voted for the Procacci report on rural development , not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme , but also because it complements the URBAN programme , which I spoke about earlier .	0.005824674626226594
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated , so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities : they are drawn by the bright lights , and the pubs , and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied .	0.01191485056254317
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed .	8.763596340958248
- (PT ) Although this Community initiative , LEADER + , follows on from previous initiatives , it has some unique features .	0.0003878796539576804
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period .	5.54396258186521
Nevertheless , new objectives have been included , specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000 , for which all rural regions will be eligible .	0.001446331501019943
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development , it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this is unacceptable .	0.072494222604476
Without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .	0.0011582952387581376
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture ' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world .	5.593034254795556
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before .	5.114920873628065
We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions .	11.585491439734438
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU ' s overall agricultural policy .	8.349530028144335
Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2 , which were implemented in the 1990s , were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and , along with other respective measures , they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU ' s rural development policy .	0.012702241755710783
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP ' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers , and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives .	0.5699378088316979
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly , which resulted in their depopulation .	0.057341696067540145
A characteristic example is Greece , which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives , and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3% , while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2% .	0.00909764549050107
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2 , for the following reasons .	0.12943292881943735
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2 , in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO .	0.7131032491235886
The present CAP , however , is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis , granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy .	0.020996709489836063
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do , in the best case , moderate some partial problems of the countryside , which are of secondary importance , but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience .	0.01018249532088423
In no case , however , are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature .	0.10272866427347345
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +) .	3.9679631904277888
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real , granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2% .	0.37727222534353283
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2 .	13.466265459606195
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU , while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions .	0.3271861027257779
We must point out , however , that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased , the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000 ' and the WTO .	0.06308580989286824
The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up , to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences .	0.26952508090304705
We disagree with many of the report ' s views .	19.391234029849183
Once more , we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000) .	0.03087718916136443
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside ' s problems , which are characterised by the decline of farming , which was and should remain the countryside ' s basic social and economic branch .	0.11043228317896168
For our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .	0.06556140111911334
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted , and most important of all , we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside .	0.19171817721579626
Unless this CAP is overthrown , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside .	0.35142312084244476
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative .	6.832638117665942
However , we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective .	0.5406905377375105
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative .	5.153382043387154
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density .	5.549274667790777
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion ' rather than 'regional development ' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area .	5.557876880635854
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials ' with 'government officials ' .	9.156617711472418
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned , government officials must be involved at decision-making level , whether they come from the municipalities , departments , regions or national governments .	0.011059241514776557
The rapporteur ' s phrasing was therefore too limiting .	20.998744901504544
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of this House .	0.1444535929749979
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG , PHARE , Sapard or MEDA .	0.01578201771332173
In the territory of Member States of the European Union , applicant countries or Member States of EFTA , there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives .	0.03270174213884994
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur .	5.8822571006846855
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union , provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners .	0.28173689831041476
In essence , we are , of course , in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative .	5.2677689035768415e-06
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union ' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric , including infrastructure , public and private services and so on .	0.17939651408977678
In this context , in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives .	0.6255843054770495
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years .	5.613906089107716
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements .	7.057059877145055
Finally , among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement , particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative , but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified .	0.10129877047423841
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m . and resumed at 3 p.m. ) Additives in feedingstuffs The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000 ) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999 ) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS) .	0.004102707245771176
Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , under Directive 70/524 , high-technology additives are treated differently , depending on the date of authorisation .	2.5836892441837113e-05
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now .	5.807206876679007
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned , so far so good .	0.20163305086245892
However , the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics , drugs , growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms .	0.00010170982342237359
That makes it a question of health , not just approximating laws , which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152 , that is to say with codecision by Parliament .	0.11068043961640049
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which pointed out that , as far as approximating laws is concerned , Article 37 is adequate in this case .	0.00719690874471969
However , we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws ; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms , we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health .	0.014205502568862024
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive , taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point .	0.5755675579297331
Mr Byrne , we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work .	0.16416339431891686
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text .	8.354978541184213
Moreover , this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well .	0.802696812942569
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .	5.51842625321897
However , that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives .	0.35203703973985906
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms .	11.385477683957696
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988 , while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur .	1.0061315582847945
We therefore assume , Commissioner Byrne , that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base .	0.0029749918468606547
If you do not , we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you , exactly as we did with the seed directive .	0.055812285936676434
I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise , both for your legal service and ours .	0.3645841224995137
In other words , we do not need to re-negotiate the text ; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive .	0.010832538163304262
I can hardly wait , Commissioner Byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .	0.003189341903653717
Mr President , Commissioner , does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?	0.00012023977713762419
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned , it comes under competition .	0.13958439700532319
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988 .	7.759135092186105
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle ' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support .	6.143824705994103
However , as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report , this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter .	0.010212342233502161
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions .	10.725822747251307
When we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs .	0.36576224669861546
The antibiotics , growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain .	0.07937030197839047
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction .	4.998676457534017
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty , we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health , whereby the accent is clearly on sources .	0.025443774554954876
Consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i.e . harmful additives in feedingstuffs .	0.00029775932079010485
Otherwise , in my view , we are beavering away at the symptoms , but not the causes .	0.00012323443886375087
People are especially wary of GMOs . We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly .	0.2321182063930939
First , if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms , then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment .	0.035246057334349414
Secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .	0.02202376875932415
And thirdly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs .	0.001976088612681295
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .	0.20022011767991413
Responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .	0.0001331781312485278
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety .	7.780760975012151
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .	0.0773625286876783
I too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .	0.0019437315996155777
Consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .	0.22402707914466988
Mr President , this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs .	0.2055872160562519
In other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months .	0.13497014913853494
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin , antibiotic , sludge and other scandals have attracted .	0.032650883437257125
In other words , this is an important facet of public health protection , which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base , not Article 37 , as proposed by the Commission .	0.0021796240642428834
The amendment which the Commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987 , is uncontested and has our full support .	0.03493233514527002
However , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal .	0.1685860965633667
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .	10.203071863713992
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded .	6.517733770040875
This sort of monopoly , which could lead , for example , to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs , should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998 .	0.002735042901628572
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed .	11.215964753447278
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion , as recommended by the rapporteur , of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives , taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point .	0.05988534552220492
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs . It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case , just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas , such as forest reproductive material , to mention just one example .	0.014736354938583437
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect .	9.377034848102529
On the one hand , it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and , on the other hand , it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs . Finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who has gone to a great deal of trouble .	0.003329141963001049
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne ' s reply .	11.628860371295627
Mr President , the report deals mainly with formalities , in other words , the manner in which additives will be authorised .	0.0002125943404339845
It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work .	11.76972640924477
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that , in future , all the directives are dealt with under Article 152 , since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview .	0.01593810133472643
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now , that is to say dealing with each detail on its own , often only after the harm has already been done .	0.043093352375736485
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives .	9.214514967656637
However , I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics .	0.09039398921447937
Certainly , five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned .	0.1514263323791722
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four , both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves .	0.4198901647484084
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health , particularly in the case of small children .	0.2745227557647715
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary .	7.5133850963958695
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same .	5.259663512761706
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotics , it has long since been forgotten .	0.013473359407608148
However , there is another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle .	0.0010397281679391066
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats .	19.200923929950534
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary .	21.233616218467468
There is a substitute , which is used to vaccinate chickens .	0.040278796597189546
Although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .	0.10606163168974923
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields .	10.970489410848487
In that way , they end up in our water supplies which , as we all know , are our most vital resource .	0.0007226845805739822
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .	0.006482171174225918
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition .	5.375204141114413
You may recall , even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public , that the Commission ' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil .	0.0794254595993919
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals .	8.635091798727128
Incidentally , it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs , cats and other domestic animals .	0.02124141536851607
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry ?	2.17141443977802
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate , even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters .	0.5124837959362077
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates .	7.357336742877805
As forcefully underlined by this report , labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock .	0.5247052576304764
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health .	4.683593927585213
In any case , the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing .	0.17713998489360766
However , before labelling we need clear rules .	0.01818496419146089
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal , for example .	0.037020636928944854
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms , it is their use which must be questioned today .	0.36733639728158946
In this respect , the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions .	0.3529551059110415
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined .	7.238371598077967
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .	0.07713988702371136
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure .	4.092052971707759
Also , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .	0.1136608628902168
Mr President , because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry , detailed information on their use is needed from the actors , and as we know there are a lot of them , so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law .	0.007234322617109984
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own .	7.701598037229032
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them .	8.553464530457036
Up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other products are sold over the shop counter , feedingstuffs and additives are structured , mixed , blended , cut and transported several times .	5.972638117831134e-05
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems , just as it does in the foodstuffs industry .	0.285329514225859
The negative consequences are well known , the positive ones less so .	0.04205879853237539
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region .	5.524579684164335
However , more work is needed on this .	0.008653016610124752
Mr President , may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on his report .	6.338432081133365e-05
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality .	8.396994876498708
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health .	6.271419735690876
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform .	0.5314886888025401
But even in this crucial area of administration , Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility .	0.5354639171840688
In Agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development .	0.00024182778296764546
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs .	0.700663817019105
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds .	8.104555136115895
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .	15.243952794655662
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne .	0.019475275463711143
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House , as well as to the concern of consumers .	0.30663564334655463
I am particularly pleased that my own country , Ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability .	0.02515721414114358
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production .	10.660878542787101
Mr President , Commissioner , I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .	0.0001876558162000866
I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group .	11.400568398158127
It is therefore specified that , through the adoption of a regulation , the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation .	0.05628042671054264
This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question .	12.797750527335866
A coherent legal framework must be re-established .	21.642631849706344
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations .	7.107185012747207
However , we must ensure that competition distortions are not created , as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi .	0.00741862280386437
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this .	5.842754224555702
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .	17.012257856343734
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget .	14.756927613947079
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety .	6.985315455845184
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which , as you know , was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .	0.025929564920254545
Mr President , we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection .	0.3740425378098969
We therefore welcome the Commission ' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs .	10.09820512309587
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking , namely the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , decided in December , on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report , that we could waive our opinion .	0.003307662772756464
Nevertheless , I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points .	0.2628434613886704
First , perhaps , I should say something on the question of the legal base .	0.0013251650181438997
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament , and it may well be that , with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture , problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment , one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict : cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned .	0.04035508811262425
Therefore , and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne , I reject your choice of legal basis .	0.005485224928830704
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives , then it is a mistake to keep it .	0.28322858728968786
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that , where people ' s health is concerned , Article 152 is the correct legal base , and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission ' s proposal and say , there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection , so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection .	0.03519752653442188
My group , as Mr Kindermann has already said , will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise .	0.027546740248675605
Mr Byrne , I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation .	0.15873060369162184
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee , we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation .	0.2233530641321106
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37 .	6.546240777195632
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points .	19.05157607313652
First , genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs .	0.01706806704162245
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law .	8.041971348571288
We do not have another law at the moment , and until we do , we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation ; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled .	0.01822545176449117
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .	19.764321013304514
I say now , as I have said on numerous occasions in the past : yes , I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House , but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs .	0.017857465640873094
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States .	4.325393140963014
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .	10.30169853743882
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .	0.010082813217183545
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future .	9.030564477690046
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers .	6.9722648628866235
We must strike a balance between them .	27.739038284758742
We must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat .	0.18895740222910215
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned .	11.584831306871408
GMOs are the new challenge facing us .	24.452509588782238
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : I myself share these concerns .	0.19531524192996802
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed .	5.763356693345327
Indeed , we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe .	0.3069417330056168
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food .	7.218829022034841
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all Member States .	0.3366149999334183
We have had the dioxin scare , BSE and many other problems .	0.0636701313157042
The main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ?	0.012494528111759455
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost .	0.4149790152610668
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred .	13.238167626509986
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union .	5.857619865228918
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future .	5.677907640686954
.	1.0
I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for examining the Commission's proposal .	0.0058872348520357404
The Commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .	0.0004000425170135659
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives .	0.162786624391553
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations , depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988 .	0.36313519815500134
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists .	12.170644945950556
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .	18.229705033609356
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament .	31.808756818191974
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments , despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament , the Agricultural Committee and , in particular , the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on these issues .	0.0005025935134969837
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .	19.845092109189153
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152 .	7.38170694089109
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection .	11.485478200059621
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health .	6.1494932129347175
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base .	5.490928203771116
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .	9.439168320056119
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position , in my view , with precision , clarity and commendable brevity .	0.005567927729818375
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives .	5.829171866555173
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue .	12.106910140799549
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary .	7.617094520675578
However , this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives .	0.0997920142200348
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage .	6.857039318060303
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220 , which is currently in second reading in Parliament .	0.38004093856726806
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments .	9.074949175570415
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001 .	5.811212806678448
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account .	5.270334900827879
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted .	3.748652598566538
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations .	6.647208208867205
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues .	6.915778483876748
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .	8.635391289583428
First of all , regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524 , and not in the Novel Feed Directive .	0.021491912619184303
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives .	11.189903749358276
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998 .	8.326083053034804
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing .	5.914841025741757
It is before Parliament for second reading .	17.007572095653867
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular , Article 11 .	0.10983216548398175
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies .	9.13727199903948
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this .	9.78821203760741
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue .	13.40051982035152
First of all , this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993 , so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers .	0.02190762880294106
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product .	10.835755267183307
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives .	9.108693413785728
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base , whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152 .	0.27030477858770346
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health .	4.982537390786267
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice , which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation .	0.9516392536094244
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this .	8.693212576693917
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here , particularly in relation to the legal base issue , it would be inappropriate , in my opinion , to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances , as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court .	0.008714946425913502
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling .	10.71038276177339
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives .	11.560161208122356
It is already included now : "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products" .	0.17785538871071616
So this issue will be addressed .	29.637651101240127
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product , the subject matter of the application .	0.5095063931150913
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question .	0.014292632564840802
First allow me to point out , Commissioner Byrne , that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative .	0.003945089624989785
But we do reserve the right , when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation , to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out .	0.06494432215758728
Nonetheless , we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content .	0.5348684417531769
For example , you did not go into antibiotics .	0.003434156146634178
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives .	13.450683388426452
My question , Commissioner Byrne is this : the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade .	0.00568803283632614
Do you really believe that , if we could , Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union ?	0.004001749896654526
Commissioner Byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament .	0.04130154679759627
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years .	12.15390438534631
I look forward to the next round .	34.406202343968786
.	1.0
I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive ; it applies only to additives .	0.14326460527402515
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue .	12.011645994297249
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in Directive 90/220 .	0.1411408638939764
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it , which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision .	0.6886425608225302
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue .	4.7061181480782395
It is my intention , as it has always been , to work in cooperation with Parliament , to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results .	0.0036343402565636802
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment , as well as the legislation in the pipeline , rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account .	0.2370301267979614
It is best to wait for that debate which , I understand , will take place fairly soon .	0.0024344080479188125
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .	15.550916102489257
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
Parliament has taken due note of your comments .	24.121078924752478
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m . Scrapie The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000 ) by Mr Bge , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998 ) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD) .	0.024223176369559927
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was and always will be one of life ' s mysteries , one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis , that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep .	0.0012864547181320163
In this respect , the Commission ' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general , comply with Parliament ' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this .	0.27238990186974094
I should , however , like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie .	0.06261355976701254
No new knowledge was needed , because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold .	0.3033685829561276
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times .	13.101800665397969
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission ' s proposal on scrapie .	13.154248075682423
I should , however , like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions .	0.024165140938081003
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal , and that of course includes scrapie .	0.3972231982617114
When we discuss the TSE regulation , Commissioner , we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation , such as cosmetics , medicinal products or animal feed .	0.007351696043687919
We insist on this .	43.583756508505246
As far as I am concerned , that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here .	0.8167663802629306
It also means that , when we are fighting these diseases , the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda .	0.1037425056879615
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation , I feel that the Commission ' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated .	1.3251862532366279
I should also like to address two other points .	19.873587004353666
We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs . Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament .	0.8722439180366719
Finally , in discussing the question of the future application of tests , we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable .	0.06653716459622842
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy , albeit not for every individual animal .	0.24773634681926424
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category , an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and , basically , where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis .	0.24097655660169875
I would be grateful , Commissioner , if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points .	0.18747628750673676
Mr President , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets .	0.0003304312047335787
Many of us here in this House have spent years , whether we intended to or not , dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail .	0.08585413359882202
And it is still on the agenda today .	30.15949195703289
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Bge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report .	5.7964149249733214
The cast is always the same .	18.623312761656297
Although the cause was unfortunate , it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament .	0.07799997667528975
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one .	11.644470778971597
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal .	6.94085278408489
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation , as Mr Bge has just done .	0.5611901396514001
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House .	8.34195896633274
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now .	10.970492630304543
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .	15.074362936390886
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity , Mr Byrne , to give the Commission a few things to think about .	0.008171873477472747
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf ' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree , things may be different with this report .	0.6981546373998003
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Bge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees , with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa , worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple .	0.38246765681099454
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal , Mr Byrne .	0.044217175278127296
When we have the chance to ask direct questions , the questions which Mr Bge referred to will be asked .	0.17923298323220377
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries .	5.9145287303661895
How will BSE status in fact be defined then ?	1.6245034268151857
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test ?	2.2645822848690904
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne , a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you .	0.2909523314508045
What about the BSE test ?	1.414213411084415
When will you make it compulsory ?	1.4859937593601396
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report .	14.570055677097638
Not that I want to put it off , but it would be a gesture , as it were , if you could say : here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test .	0.0014206354330161296
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this , but sometimes that is my job .	0.21815262640720712
I say quite emphatically , even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , who is completely involved in the whole idea , that animal feeding , animal rearing , animal production must be suited to the species and must also , above all , cause no harm or danger to human beings .	0.00038553936753609835
Cosmetic , medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous .	0.23864293409476411
That is , without doubt , too short , too sweet and too little .	2.4909767456021123e-06
You are lucky that Mr Bge ' s report only deals with this on the sidelines ; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so .	0.6357637835290327
Finally , just one more brief comment , Mr Byrne .	5.837458504898654e-05
We have a new Commission .	52.09595314799598
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission , only time will tell .	0.29046034132241133
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that , as a lawyer and politician you will understand this .	0.3731926221749679
Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes .	25.246755234657428
They belong in the legislative text .	36.4639653585478
I might do the same if I were a Commissioner , because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament , which takes so long and is so difficult .	0.11542371721701886
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .	9.293259839433235
In other words , whenever I get the chance , I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text .	0.02140126559150972
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset .	10.177976450991169
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe , healthy food which is produced , as a matter of principle , without any questionable or risky interim or end products .	0.0030088647520474477
Over recent years , these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed .	0.25304330448917955
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals .	7.858134457560867
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because , in the final analysis , it is our health which is at stake .	0.011182022944159051
The Commission ' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie .	5.747689084372413
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated .	9.349904081336538
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent .	12.873437116088
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers .	5.731658269270509
And I should point out that , for the first time in history , a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago .	0.013095158204602787
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food .	5.327376091183303
The disease is always fatal .	52.09875912016859
As there is no vaccination , farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie .	0.3442898990295753
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings , the connection with BSE has still not been clarified , as I have already said .	0.016303859839695668
As a farmer myself , I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk .	0.1436995407117072
I am in favour of preventive measures , starting with feeding which is suitable for the species , rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out .	0.049189519559428824
I therefore welcome the Commission ' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie .	11.795263412280306
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Bge ' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament ' s temporary BSE Committee .	0.024555811130472692
Mr Bge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee , and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him : he is the one with the experience .	0.18696060827137065
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission ' s proposal .	5.4921538558343945
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session .	0.707390357867122
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease .	8.743122038337683
It is indeed .	87.4243336973587
For me as a Finn , and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals , it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals .	0.2904495450526175
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease .	12.270017978562606
The possibility , if necessary , of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement , as there really is justification for it .	0.004932861193564545
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU .	4.720967203035004
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats , we can support the Commission ' s proposal on Mr Bge ' s report , but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur .	0.17508354710996116
Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur .	0.014878805996405882
There is no doubt that Mr Bge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field .	6.723726192544557
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important .	9.450348614088933
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have , BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved .	0.3651021276887412
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem .	8.302785607768818
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , I hope , address this situation .	0.006623924880987251
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future .	4.6251948553463205
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again .	10.582676142498086
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .	16.44775434027864
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .	5.705444010264886
BSE has certainly not gone away .	37.7990913265107
You can see it in different countries .	22.802888833690698
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom .	0.41719054870103084
It will be there for some time to come .	21.027826343702678
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence-building mechanism .	0.06436283451135097
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future .	8.900076425489402
Finally , I have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place .	0.04349388625706985
It was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again .	0.42312425459527353
.	1.0
Mr President , I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission , namely combating TSEs . I should also like to thank Mr Bge for his work on this issue .	0.019656993279559845
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs . This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain .	0.8504910735420904
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases .	6.3200788697367924
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation .	4.605889485959742
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal .	12.222260016343117
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative , as appears from your contributions this afternoon , to formulate a single text .	0.013690731372613264
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation , especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue .	0.5128005045029567
I look forward to receipt of that document , which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue .	0.26099439027377147
Finally , I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions , speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation .	0.24608801921321713
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system , I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve , that is , the translation of policy into legislation .	0.036354531481730394
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m . Community policy in the field of water The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000 ) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD ) (Rapporteur : Mrs Lienemann) .	0.1750418277356696
- (FR ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century .	0.0021786866709927414
Climate change , global resources , river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future .	0.002048009572854339
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet ' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions , the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even , more fundamentally , the global balance .	0.05273689847331634
To support this statement , I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague , Mrio Soares , in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans .	0.0053394034295706876
When talking about climate change , we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere .	0.2038395245223241
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet .	7.7706441221287585
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent , both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters , including its groundwater , surface waters and seas .	0.031631346099570835
Furthermore , Europe has signed international conventions , in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments .	0.0065234197657788075
In this it said that in a few years ' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances .	5.2003205348478385
Despite having signed these international agreements , this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened .	0.7717097218407769
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy , the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives , particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR .	0.1425415087558558
This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action .	9.589673886416978
The European Union ' s water policy is not starting from zero .	18.0124162940133
Many directives have already been adopted .	38.055165491514195
Furthermore , the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives .	0.27761963629829733
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .	11.156508359666383
However , at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made , like OSPAR , but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs .	0.00967903641378918
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved .	0.9424356740877636
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts .	6.829771593242117
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us .	12.386077154000105
Yet we do not have much time .	30.00355229893571
We could , as the Commission has proposed , accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further .	0.005236343970365255
Yet if we do , we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public , but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again .	0.05540662753749245
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved .	11.498359913436378
I am stressing this point because , when disasters are being reported daily in the news , we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done .	0.07004495456214627
Then , in our haste , we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time .	0.02309263127101659
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development , clear requirements , controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers , this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time .	0.07072677233407947
It is also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner .	0.3445726860244314
Even now , the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism .	0.02168808391059821
To conclude , the issues are clear at this second reading .	0.003965017384895038
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR , in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero ?	0.07102674803595158
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive ?	3.069245636774114
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water ?	2.7232005517534796
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?	1.9939566457255595
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives .	0.2808619120515148
I hope they will be supported by this House .	12.778931509614543
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us , especially as the very source of life for human beings .	0.005468516299286152
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources , of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe , especially in very dry regions .	0.03682073662116944
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallstrm , who is responsible in this area , cannot be here now because this is , after all , a very , very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time , and water protection legislation , which we are debating now at second reading , affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join , who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede .	0.0014371748933535012
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994 .	0.7454172033388337
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers .	0.27527108047202037
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77 , but another 30 have been added .	0.188090174319552
You see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different .	0.0375312132709529
Some want tighter legislation , some want more clarification , others want to serve national interests .	0.002455553758812546
Even within my group , the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , there were , of course , differences of opinion .	0.0001343560307580285
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions .	14.624841904802237
In this sense , the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position .	0.4222885719982729
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers .	6.327581583054759
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament ' s credibility .	10.70437116495133
For me , that includes the zero demand , i.e . the demand for zero inputs up to 2020 .	4.423338436862565e-05
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings .	8.84271420817285
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws , however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States .	0.7653334715857838
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine , which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe , which was particularly polluted .	0.12128455325685367
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money .	5.438606976398311
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days .	13.766905080467309
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water .	10.473014154926563
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too .	6.6831870474014305
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter .	6.836210107422067
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises .	7.178373591508424
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agreed to differ on certain points .	0.004706948510963508
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission , who stood by with advice and expert help at all times .	0.22943480128000135
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach , then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure .	0.7856344149708401
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water .	0.3241297003520453
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .	23.879903468653104
Nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .	0.102394389686059
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .	7.417228480775383
However , in Spain and the other southern countries , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures .	0.009267891258353107
Therefore , we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and , to this end , I ask that you support Amendment No 95 , which has been presented by our group .	0.005193969781758415
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable , efficient , fair and considerate use of water .	0.012324102058542303
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here .	6.182236439442805
One example is water transfers .	57.52167703046667
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision .	8.29368499977221
We consider that , given the hydrological characteristics of Spain , where transfers of a structural nature are carried out , the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources , and these decisions should , of course , always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water .	0.0020739741831644087
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate , the application of tariffs , the Spanish Socialists have been arguing , in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay , that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption .	0.011564969773503428
In Spain , a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe .	0.18730091064631874
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses , owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive .	0.8434319233659233
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs .	8.348296928557584
This system should take good account of social , environmental and economic effects , and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions .	0.027340656298680547
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment .	16.602441058116515
However , an environmental Europe cannot , in any circumstances , be built at different speeds , but must be built from a point of view of solidarity .	0.0004366780324028336
Mr President , the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all .	0.19410695968280348
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe .	6.774762647428559
This brings home the connections which bind us together .	14.94945508072067
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details .	6.22212530264615
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework .	21.861110098382085
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad .	34.661920686470935
It is easy for individual countries , for individual sectors of industry , to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days .	0.026088770450891682
There are many opportunities to hide .	33.43761235499555
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come .	7.121354909857899
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail .	15.826278875190738
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater , the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals , which we all need in society in all circumstances , should not be finding their way into our water system .	0.10471596792035831
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation .	11.686826845104644
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing .	5.619143577647694
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing .	19.707648190979032
The principle also concerns water charging .	34.661917128980775
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation , to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water .	0.9685188385503862
I want to refer to the political position here .	29.538396725551877
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading .	9.745000750270924
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless .	12.785989036886923
It is a retrograde step .	82.03476486869828
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .	21.486189353203553
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation .	19.923012764780513
We have seen vote after vote lost .	30.80822289800416
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee .	14.189696316969329
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority .	22.47024630959166
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed .	15.550870070003985
We need to get into that conciliation position .	30.102906316904402
We need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost .	0.001540337771984432
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy .	0.0008660277908605431
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated .	13.394030319018706
Eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .	0.07703097596692289
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle .	15.034298309981539
Some seven years ago , it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity .	0.23972448236941174
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English .	4.073180632330712
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency .	9.835249509804461
That position is like holey cheese , or to keep it the sphere of water , as leaky as a sieve .	0.010555991465072759
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment : nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading .	0.26098758106898545
This is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .	0.11487917234034074
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak .	21.867546828249825
The chemical industry and , unfortunately , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance .	0.022483694040736017
This is very time-consuming , and , more importantly , there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances .	0.0002514416448938699
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable .	19.629051218023704
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero " .	17.484059779078464
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances , many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect .	0.17540298826738043
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause , even in extremely minimal quantities , changes in the gender of animals and even humans , as is more and more being ascertained by scientists .	0.007222633143441695
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020 .	8.335499184794768
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission ' s list : mercury and tributyl , abbreviated to TBT .	0.019030666927445428
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea , the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value , to wit , ten and one thousand times , respectively .	0.000505722188561435
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes , and if this is impossible , to apply them in closed systems .	0.0608622247432811
For the substance TBT , this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance .	0.22660738070311293
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides mechanically .	11.852678310159137
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020 .	5.0322781645817205
Mr President , the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive .	0.06137551270714834
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas .	10.631052881440043
Therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .	0.15693799133259378
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals .	0.4581903262047049
Firstly , we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council .	0.19105161733385786
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive .	8.572060738543518
Secondly , I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently .	0.13826242340557998
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented .	6.948227892390519
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions , such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected .	0.2982865918092704
Thirdly , we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy .	0.043173895969263354
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used .	9.972984578059393
Nowadays , taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming .	0.04131023224612634
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay , although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases .	0.31519678011258323
Fourthly , we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined .	0.2101907413183572
Fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear .	0.18458631039137793
Against that background , our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopted in committee .	0.0026274631985605226
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended .	21.30660603595891
We will therefore vote for the Greens ' Amendments Nos 102 , 103 and 104 , which we consider to be improvements on the present position .	0.02819377178684864
As regards pricing policy , there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report .	0.17193785334554948
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43 , tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens ' Amendment No 105 .	0.7255245298371428
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned .	7.3560638700653636
However , some people in our political group think otherwise .	0.029328758710304412
Consequently , Amendment No 107 , on the same question , has been tabled by one section of our group only .	0.000616671111941277
On the whole , I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise .	0.33171974056182596
Mr President , every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the abundance of water is an illusion .	0.011534897101679336
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders .	5.3732411492876535
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource .	15.26266229189256
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable .	9.335706590575324
In the EU , this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas .	0.40769917350073104
The increase in vulnerable areas , both wet and dry , inequalities between countries , inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic , economic , geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need .	0.0005550684211849383
However , these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community .	0.03470078357713153
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land .	0.6286273970275144
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive .	6.3726188896813065
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought .	16.34840964344613
Last October in Turin , the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean .	0.21807783685019533
We are not , fortunately , at this point .	1.8541561182725883e-05
However , we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods , which the directive underlines .	0.006910380534182629
For example , France , the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding .	0.0002548700460173069
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other .	5.028007825881987
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water .	6.664565422392839
The water issue will definitely not be settled today .	18.73840798842804
In fact , the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects .	0.016113526433733497
Mr President , it is very likely that , during this century , good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil .	0.0006835346581061981
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water .	6.5932567954102765
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework .	10.223868318186435
With the framework directive on water policy , we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU ' s water legislation .	0.23601200310586865
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies .	5.307369702483152
More specifically , the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards , which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach , need to be maximised .	0.004821574035760318
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water , the protection of eco systems , the promotion of the sustainable use of water , the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water .	0.0249334164999445
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned , I am of the opinion that the Councils ' objectives lack both commitment and ambition .	0.28022102936522963
The Committee on the Environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of emulation .	0.02473119209112304
However , a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability .	0.07301780220253834
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced , as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control , and which pollute the water quite substantially .	0.0522952656257097
Mr President , we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect .	0.17453252441185346
In the 20th century , water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances , special waste , chemicals and so on .	0.0010985915253054971
And we can already see the consequences ! We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation .	5.00725808147234
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here .	7.522237714788109
In the final analysis , water protection is not just a social question , it is a decisive social question , which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences .	0.01784733771502402
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources , it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements .	0.448051930259406
Mr President , it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher , put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety .	0.006589104464034694
It is not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed .	0.012789738758287358
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage .	10.80593870929097
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have been able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading .	0.050893554828065686
In fact , the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal .	0.10848494266152274
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge .	11.097398804364548
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect : in the North of Europe , we often face floods , but also polluted water , from industry , whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances , simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture .	0.0016839021947280862
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail .	11.216908430366301
I would first of all like to focus on quality .	21.01634626633296
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy .	18.100648742177277
A very important component , to wit , one third of our drinking water , is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands .	0.000652871793691566
The Netherlands is located downstream , in a delta , which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance .	0.027332180632361962
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .	11.21595403943898
In a number of amendments , the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question .	0.16502485656646823
Although I understand that , according to some , this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially , I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure .	0.02573428129575925
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management .	11.994443869953685
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland " [ "Reminiscing about Holland " ] , a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too , which , with its never-ending trail of destruction , was feared and respected .	0.0015267542027013544
In 1953 , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .	0.1814016748637306
When our rivers flooded in 1990 , we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage .	0.3023652959099947
This means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .	0.5629972006363979
Mr President , I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work .	0.030130152655227217
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right .	15.983866842841916
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident , as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too .	0.6942574694827598
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples .	12.205013337821672
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination .	12.44757432339781
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability .	29.55047944184361
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident .	19.59241842137104
Too little operational capacity upstream or , in fact , excessive use , can cause problems downstream .	3.503537735534964e-05
Coordination is the key word here .	44.20687104844832
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical .	30.51511658578816
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation .	8.167159238650154
Some areas are becoming drier , whilst many are becoming wetter .	0.048117867973394395
It is time for action .	59.38445798285104
In March , the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague .	0.01995069438141908
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision .	25.246756660414615
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control .	7.65605779998606
The time for action is upon us .	26.066788668615434
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time .	4.721033359900025
But we should not lower our standards too much either .	17.572147935946838
The common position is not ambitious enough .	32.22731472019804
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements , or the OSPAR objectives .	0.15084470964194194
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020 .	12.427995669686705
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too .	9.1094202020346
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up .	16.484491918711104
A list has been compiled , containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment .	0.1161965401108257
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again .	5.235842043256633
Needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .	0.02856867532684371
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives .	11.112539359799952
Quality has a price , but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future .	0.12090025607824323
Mr President , Commissioner , my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive .	0.0016375485596009565
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change , the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing , constantly affect our common and vital but , in some ways , unowned resources .	0.007449400843867173
We should also recognise that , in Europe , our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one .	0.020949569563954006
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established .	14.888872701204546
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are , irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse .	0.6437610205481765
Ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive does indeed , as many speakers have already said , represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe .	0.02607661906888366
However , I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation .	0.19920475591236553
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points .	7.823405053804743
First OSPAR .	1.0
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough ; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment .	0.39033165456302327
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough .	12.8764661724398
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR .	16.736736036249983
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and , more importantly , objectives which are enforceable under the law .	0.0050981729557634204
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters , such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary , from happening to us .	0.07108271173079281
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection , despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR .	0.3676663472575633
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament , in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised .	0.8719703204765832
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .	9.181169892489358
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists ; on the contrary , we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and , hence , cost-covering prices .	0.0033880970455021117
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention .	6.227179047209924
With closed production circuits this is possible ; anything else would water down the directive .	0.09199332077982693
Let us grab our chance .	52.09874456373793
Mr President , in the small amount of time allotted to me , I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann ' s report and remind the House of three principles , to which all other principles must be subordinate , which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur ' s amendments : water is not a commercial product , but the property of all the peoples of the Union ; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater , and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity .	0.01187651685610726
I know that this directive may have problems , given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union , as has already been mentioned .	0.01890098135194821
The situation in the north is different from that in the south , and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas .	0.586738312347884
I understand this .	116.76430993654691
However , there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south , specifically Amendment No 43 which , with regard to the recuperation of costs , also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making .	0.022584908538326846
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers .	27.225418908115707
In my country - I live in the north of Spain - , there is a considerable difference between the north and the south , and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another .	0.10596895270308497
However , Mrs Lienemann ' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water .	0.33542605864177266
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties , but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doana .	0.9980813831827342
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted , Mr President , and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water , which is so precious to all of us .	0.012761331249896165
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report .	0.01602940389367488
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive .	0.04867882407215287
However , I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council .	0.20304154172111952
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter .	8.85580521614865
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force , whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years .	1.0434228246428516
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .	5.791442912409105
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage .	7.2327479393964484
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage .	8.727200017919985
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .	7.625702531419629
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently .	7.601030160795788
Moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented .	0.0004460331482620282
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states .	6.0669411285897885
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal , Greece and Spain .	0.04301997157637937
Mr President , I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report .	0.05482398560727816
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come .	5.902420814758123
We can do this by , as a Parliament , amending the Council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .	0.0350690834076065
In its unaltered form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water .	0.0014517997333554145
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people .	10.226542404824457
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .	7.947512607836239
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation .	0.7852809594046296
We cannot afford to wait .	39.34098407654679
In this connection , I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108 , in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants " are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges " .	0.08491118065795951
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment .	4.685864410217985
The EU ' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention , which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment .	0.3038868434121762
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and , not least , to our descendants .	0.011415713107747047
Mr President , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .	0.04541495427967353
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention , for the implementation of the 'polluter pays ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment .	0.34129260916720056
Clearly , the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems , seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage , particularly our water resources .	0.0742157194856198
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector .	0.09400575000973836
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture , environment and water resources , and between positive and negative effects , and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on .	0.030621736283176444
This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards , along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income .	0.6043498307926315
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion , with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions .	0.6684827917383432
We must not , with this in mind , pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting , improving and restoring their quality , as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques .	0.048988806292273104
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment , an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels , which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities .	0.1977627336025094
Finally , we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances , using the increased information available on their chemical , physical and biological properties , in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage , which is fundamental to us all .	0.012197101772108648
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously , then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption .	0.017247069357093688
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards .	11.270226844896904
In this respect , I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that , when people use water , they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks .	0.024313977922547334
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting .	11.670176698202091
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public , a rarity in a European directive .	0.13066188799216533
Secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .	0.004264327426666902
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality .	5.169402939790531
Thirdly , I should like to address the question of the timetable .	0.06643798175614378
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict , tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective .	0.3476414383654022
Compare it with what happens in December .	25.246741498661176
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents .	7.857419670014737
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years ' time .	5.77577457647303
We all know what we would do , which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy .	0.17530061771311525
I emphatically support the rapporteur ' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive , from the list of measures to the question of employment measures .	0.6068137815737563
Mr President , the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater , drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation .	0.11098035277834281
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States , in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution .	0.5767293933214325
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .	7.4219036333404
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances .	4.581384165512128
This cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .	3.8519954420172636e-05
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of , for example , phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment .	0.15415496127382372
European agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread .	0.022248404376898123
As a result , agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU , with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs .	0.014014443926493507
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs .	6.526284985681021
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , water is a precious raw material .	0.00011537292926156462
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .	5.877481666182736
It should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .	0.0004674048973270706
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs .	9.2715028299128
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation .	12.87332177086431
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task ; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation .	0.3866967226761606
I have to admit that in Flanders , where I come from , we still have a long way to go too .	0.011835243342180819
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter .	10.990148704696573
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way .	5.837614756153959
The common position is in this respect a farce , a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements .	0.4342533235243918
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years .	10.725823612868789
By then , my children will be older than I am now .	0.008356361370844594
You have to admit : this is a joke .	0.012276087508775253
Tomorrow , we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children .	0.24192493371883847
Either we opt for the amendments of my group , of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment .	0.08968355595205262
I would like to finish off with this observation .	22.391421257917937
In the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium .	0.13784564589222395
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers .	6.380818312555771
In our own country , this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations .	0.09887791390897567
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament ' s more drastic positioning .	11.663891666617724
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware .	8.643281398443552
Ladies and gentlemen , fine words are no longer sufficient .	0.04822702924045714
We need to change tack completely .	57.1936726591111
During the vote tomorrow , we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy .	0.16181483926978021
This can only benefit our credibility .	30.662425271012378
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m . The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform : the issues at stake .	0.025024416669035553
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today .	0.010362698580323036
I am basically here to speak to you , as indicated by your agenda , on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform .	0.08908375334170136
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction , with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner , the Council ministers and national MPs . It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction .	0.06232979491377857
This morning , in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi , many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions .	0.012257117276937127
Yet it is not just a question of who does what , as one of you said very clearly and forcefully .	0.2225405668267895
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do .	6.181114822825965
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future , particularly with the countries which will be joining us .	0.5665743300956051
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy , and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe ' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people .	0.5078593167144445
This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference .	6.586148132702238
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos .	0.41045185898802955
All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region , and not just their own , which in my case happens three or four times a month , to engage in direct dialogue with the public , and not just with the lite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course .	0.028053470138428998
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities , schools and factories , to meet the people , answer their questions and listen to them .	0.0018266676557424028
In this way we will play our part , as will you , in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do .	0.07254686515595848
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament .	5.779135099241795
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work .	5.293130767641796
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments , local elected representatives , non-governmental organisations , socio-professional organisations and the media .	0.0017111607836907544
Opinion multipliers , political groups and parties , MEPs and national MPs , elected representatives , as I have just said , local authorities or national parliaments , the Committee of the Regions , the Economic and Social Committee , organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved .	8.381502988018231e-05
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February ?	2.8115889261295397
I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are , of course , the representatives of the people in each Member State .	0.03430354388692958
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership .	7.802720030847764
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament .	7.403064059946539
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits .	7.0878925168685525
We want to encourage debate among the people .	17.359808885535767
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you , may I just point out that , when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country , I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people ?	0.0243118755383347
Each week , when engaging in this dialogue in each region , I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face .	0.024692554016709306
I therefore took a European Commissioner , and not just the French ones , or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week .	0.03713768083438063
This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected , listened to and informed .	0.24043415639846066
So this is what we are going to do .	18.01237788459311
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve .	10.484542367864588
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001 .	6.075754415941841
It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process .	10.06562392354272
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires .	7.087901616378572
Your President , Mrs Fontaine , has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue .	0.00287867166362717
I can assure you that , whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue , the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament .	0.15840023776047676
That is all I have to say for the moment .	14.756371936381212
I welcome any questions , suggestions or proposals from the Members present .	0.05506310977130888
Colleagues , you know the rules .	0.0026914648160049617
You are expected to ask questions , not necessarily make lengthy statements .	0.056911970922400995
You have one minute each in which to ask your question .	12.035018256772501
Mr President , I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair , in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative .	0.011302311552699066
Moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November .	0.15510353369895002
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme .	7.944728276827862
If I may make a suggestion , Commissioner Barnier , would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject , in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament ?	0.019155143395068627
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination , specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments , but also members of national parliaments - and our committee ' s programme .	0.224138392485297
Following the working meeting of 1 February , which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission , the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings .	0.09491984050660048
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings , and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission ' s initiative .	0.6698737643732229
Thank you , Mr Napolitano .	1.7847605974074312e-05
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November .	9.142087553199275
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague , Viviane Reding .	0.653200295217191
This initiative was also established in conjunction with Gnter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement , both its opportunities and risks , and of institutional reform .	0.032588387256620374
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them .	9.089111346106394
I understand your concern , Mr Napolitano , and an interinstitutional working group will be set up .	0.0014210842079939677
Its first meeting should take place in March .	18.856175303170076
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission ' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other .	6.168105287151371
I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint .	6.554551010171568
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned .	9.481651305472434
Mr President , Commissioner , it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen ' so often .	0.0023968056478573378
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion .	15.243993770358435
The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it .	5.874597116982156
In terms of the IGC issue , I have a specific question for you .	0.08747016910094439
I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF .	7.376643685036555
As you know , there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens .	0.22326736966706562
Given the urgency surrounding this issue , has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud , in the Member States and in the European institutions , coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice ?	0.029269903682514784
Mr Dupuis , first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen ' .	0.08192704670707
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used .	9.66098204205329
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens , including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres .	0.17559643755305018
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud , and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests , we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor .	0.1560465317060246
We have done this in the spirit of this House ' s work and perhaps by going down the same road .	8.967425978990246
This public prosecutor would have the authority , recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States , to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests .	0.03743945822702606
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community .	3.7895040357186
This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could , having investigated a case from start to finish , then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court .	0.12019670884093565
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice , we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago .	0.5134107682926691
The Commission , as I have promised , will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks .	0.021829716378598533
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the day before yesterday , there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme , which I would ask you to comment on .	0.00033127610219835273
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that , because he was Austrian , he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries , including Denmark .	0.033114014499619475
I would ask you to confirm that , if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects , then this official has got the wrong end of the stick , and that , if he has not said this , then there is no story .	0.004639844854804119
Will you confirm what is the case ?	1.8858492882944267
Mr Haarder , to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing .	0.02402933730427832
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition .	0.5722739582395056
Therefore , subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting , I can confirm what you have just said , that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort .	0.011870067737108133
Generally speaking , there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria .	0.02278804760104002
I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957 .	6.893209700433444
This is an economic community , of course , but it is also , primarily , a community of values .	7.025418235638344e-06
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis .	5.997077677305075
This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed , in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis , should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity .	0.13082724835445145
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis .	5.275803305945769
Finally , this is why we have public debate .	0.016856640397284184
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives , which brings me back to the subject of our discussion .	0.32844470907614864
I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate , particularly to fight against demagoguery .	0.14661794505844059
Commissioner Barnier , you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe .	0.06935133877078581
With reference to the IGC , as you know , under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC .	0.06957193186202881
Clearly , Parliament has its own representatives present , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos .	0.0011065909397416328
But would you , Commissioner , also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you , with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress ?	0.05679045917824271
Mr Beazley , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .	0.01376907133274437
Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that , on behalf of the Commission , I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations , in a spirit of transparency .	0.002211886334451411
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that , in many cases , we will say this together .	0.04859998032343526
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which , when all said and done , will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process .	0.1321723750804005
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano ' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament .	5.275918125840526
Having said that , the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions .	0.17480451620593715
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year .	6.7484175507032775
Mr President , firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach .	0.0262341500824504
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage .	7.991662254095395
This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust .	8.010865867923146
I have two questions .	51.78843316199373
Firstly , you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission .	0.5005516410946774
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and Internet ?	0.06027515293162573
My second question is of a critical nature .	24.476117902295
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency .	18.77632886201913
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands , then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model , and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands .	0.08860331326554262
My question is really : how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC , because the present directive is not a good example of this .	0.032260771012817435
Mrs Maij-Weggen , given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC , it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now .	0.017307276000381983
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible .	5.441467609100155
The documents will in the main be open working documents .	15.034191452454357
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media , I am committed , as I must be at this stage , to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission ' s viewpoint .	0.08548851405014209
I can confirm , and thank you for having asked me about this , that we will use all the most modern means , television in particular , to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe .	0.0030552905427097396
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums .	11.57130152585553
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised .	11.571302713727645
These are the modern means to be used .	17.70737523858542
However , I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .	0.15708031331667052
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal , I want a Commissioner , when he can , an MEP , a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe .	0.0008048399425160107
I have evidence that this is possible .	30.434409736934402
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions .	9.36655627090091
Although this may seem rather egotistical , I want the Commission , in the minds of the people , to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible .	0.013443322037870908
Mr President , I welcome Mr Barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say .	0.012733295287287756
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire , a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding .	0.5983208354431547
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner .	7.908952534050085
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign ?	3.7311366458810924
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be .	6.543478518414206
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist .	5.641686459637539
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign .	7.913682370124878
Mr Corbett , thank you for your comments .	0.0013361144970975983
I willingly accept your invitation .	52.098748946984415
If I have understood you correctly , you want me , when I come to Yorkshire , to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds .	0.009159371469224359
I can perform this dual task .	34.661916851437724
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments , as I have already done , not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ .	0.051071067319133696
Ten days ago I was in Westminster , so you can see , Mr Corbett , that I am not afraid of the difficulties .	0.0006955493422854319
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin .	15.399052061593787
I have already appeared before the French Senate .	26.80775887329962
Therefore , throughout this debate , whenever I can , I will go directly to see the national parliaments too .	0.0004199979218332627
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens , it is not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication .	0.01595342611713667
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue .	24.325427442589174
So , after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform , those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion .	0.021435011225144407
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States .	5.212854523587888
I sincerely hope , with your support , that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate .	0.02747645773101196
Mr President , I should like to join Mr Barnier ' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with .	0.17575474985881667
It is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .	0.0023369666557081954
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference , Mr Barnier said , during his presentation in Parliament , that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but , when I look at page 63 , I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say , the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination , the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and , with a few exceptions , of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting .	0.0015677647715368617
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States ' election processes ?	2.435507960605546
It is , of course , these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments .	0.006913419501762292
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels ?	1.4142129674412642
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning ?	1.9833743769763146
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference , not merely to relations between the Union and Member States , but also the Union , the Member States , regions and cities .	0.011656590687952939
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe , Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears .	0.34427290360018264
Commissioner , I want to go back to one of your previous answers .	0.07763532079544994
In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and , in particular , the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State , pursuant to Article 7 , for the violation of fundamental freedoms .	0.008548175916210324
Do you believe that these proposals , or proposals of this type , form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki ?	0.00818544250386147
I do not think so .	79.42790936207723
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion , unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking ?	0.3052407594549659
Yes , Mr Bonde , we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission .	0.028643192687210974
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated .	12.290417063885526
In terms of social protection , I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology .	0.3162479863637243
In your country , Mr Bonde , like everywhere else , I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people .	0.008509772604525912
This will therefore be our rule .	45.61729214294212
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market .	4.529119297561018
Our proposal is not general or systematic .	25.2467566731492
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues .	11.427856024749186
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical .	17.292470132366912
This has never been the case .	23.83520726458145
We are simply trying to ensure , in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States , the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27 .	0.08239745657614313
Mr MacCormick , I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals .	0.0186809208450589
It must get as close as possible to the people , where they live and where they have their roots .	0.16246554117421594
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions .	5.191305664815918
You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people , where they live , to preserve their roots , traditions , soul and identity .	0.014847019832522299
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions .	14.844784521231778
Mr Berthu , the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this .	0.017963372943429094
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam .	7.574634549974967
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies .	7.76414847759178
The Commission is acting correctly if , on a particular point , it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions .	0.020306760936627474
I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7 .	16.133064961986893
However , if we do , this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response .	0.09525166030735085
We will also do this with regard for the future in general .	12.89496659239331
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957 , and even before that , on the rubble of the Second World War .	0.13083543689238378
Everything which can be done will be useful .	25.344768118044847
I am sure that you and I , Mr Berthu , can at least agree on this .	0.0014128358627185273
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to .	5.538865960089981
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today .	17.60929967114255
That concludes the debate .	51.17529818162962
Question Time (Commission ) The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000) .	12.15989475096814
We will examine questions to the Commission .	9.113399068438891
First part Question No 36 by (H-0025/00) : Subject : High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation , Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe ; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die , while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm .	0.01860690140453925
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner , will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women , women in childbirth and babies ?	0.13833106546482624
Mr President , the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo , not just for pregnant women but across the board .	0.013792984389275826
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it .	6.245989658277106
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable .	9.156613788535568
However , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population .	0.042054443055672956
The Commission ' s response has been as follows : firstly , the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding .	0.015822771332214106
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care , on support to institutions as well as vaccination .	0.268784173432798
However , efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province .	0.14137519360961998
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field .	12.203555420870394
Secondly , under the reconstruction programme , urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme .	0.026494798844050975
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .	10.511262022948422
However , the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project .	0.09402919537265045
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation .	9.661105013829852
Under the European Community ' s damage assessment , estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million .	0.5561825360260004
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .	19.69606783312755
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system .	10.419636806233086
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement .	9.876418925340799
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise .	9.526628020155961
Commissioner , this morning President Prodi , among others , stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively , the very credibility of the European Union is on trial , and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed .	0.0012915774433413072
Commissioner , do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo , are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises ?	0.1477555819217064
Besides , Commissioner , is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo ?	0.0011622307796460105
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when , on the continent of Europe itself , the right to life is at risk ?	0.005575331004069156
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by .	0.13252584822225397
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that .	15.480631299508234
Of course , she is entirely correct in saying that the Union ' s credibility is on the line with what happens , not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole .	0.03665711511132955
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance .	7.603759722509091
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines .	8.2903976648444
First of all , I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo , and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all .	0.12737809041342107
As a result of that , a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society .	0.22474385298000676
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment .	8.890623132587729
Secondly , and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well , some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby , but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born .	0.045766995762877176
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities , or before the hostilities , tragically killed their own children .	0.014559366038999794
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo .	13.302374570121438
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour , but it is not going to be easy .	0.6933987851090658
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for your response to the Member ' s first question and the supplementary question .	0.3077078434824487
However , I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO , among others , are often of inferior quality .	0.003141035639515749
In some cases , there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like .	0.07135401475389243
Are you aware of this ?	1.2599202813731247
Are you prepared to act upon it ?	1.622388915769356
This is my first additional question .	37.79908190326374
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica .	10.936180937370128
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that , given the tense situation , Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all .	0.0999829278173511
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital ?	2.7924213297255673
On the first question , I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package .	0.6770950549482138
I have not heard that suggestion before , but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there .	0.37668894156664906
Secondly , I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica .	0.09098767389170272
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago , I saw the situation there for myself .	0.16820753612384426
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities , including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently .	0.6740172765840681
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo , whatever ethnic group they come from .	1.0806913671316714
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example , it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital , Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems .	0.06907552873107402
We will try to address them , but it is not easy .	0.04467657310432161
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00) : Subject : Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social , economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999 , what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ?	0.013674845810900397
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries .	4.806501974493013
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey , as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict .	0.5924153920650341
Mr President , the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union .	0.05339073677285404
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because , in the final analysis , we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union ?	0.039445176057046734
My question therefore is this : will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions ?	0.07507571856013755
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can .	5.027780718741445
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia .	9.701498659184542
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union .	5.079142997259424
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will , as the honourable Member asks , be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy .	0.023452995576985654
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote : "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts" .	0.16132615786017548
That statement could not be much clearer .	33.84900462230771
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .	7.065719182074216
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00) : Subject : Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status , what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam , given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result ?	0.0335423550744942
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region .	6.8638286581569385
We will , however , consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities , together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey .	0.004432781982357428
I have a related point .	75.95540674218307
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole .	7.419953999600616
As you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular .	0.1677009059162135
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict , of so-called "water wars" , in the coming decades , what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation , both in Turkey and in the wider region , that will be caused by this dam ?	0.0061503494145223065
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ?	1.8379262927269586
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member .	9.452437498618792
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up .	8.947562680569673
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area .	5.636632790498586
We will raise that , too , in the representations we make .	0.00021425343548101146
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern , such as the effect on displaced farmers .	0.34191964041603157
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form .	6.087617380501567
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00) : Subject : Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up .	0.04461763002785281
It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century .	7.346292382495283
What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter ?	1.8697825428742498
What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic , social and cultural) ?	0.010856194431528214
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement ?	2.197541028780092
Will it cover immigrants etc.? ) Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda ?	0.0
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?	1.6924384004917243
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ?	1.5981911258059167
Like the honourable Member , the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .	0.28904159877615065
In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter ' s content .	5.565004982629812
According to these conclusions , the Charter must contain three categories of rights .	0.05575371888884269
The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights , as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .	0.41402129561393824
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union .	5.6342477949046526
The third is economic and social rights , as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers , insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union .	0.1261015876717017
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council .	5.315258181534427
Having said that , this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources .	0.3277637455679369
As I have said before in this House , the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able , if necessary , to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances , particularly technological and social changes .	0.002709760232227753
However , given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government , this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis .	0.06342717417930399
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary .	9.61481151535889
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union .	4.483905782673762
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions .	6.401582858738491
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail .	6.741763236302876
However , I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights .	0.5339944787829982
This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States .	3.6954044322336683
As I have also said before to this House , the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty .	0.17329471324337975
However , we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government .	0.21486532982203477
The difficult part , which will fall to the Convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties .	0.03841614843926884
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties , the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda , in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .	0.14879656074697106
Commissioner , it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe , men and women , are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations .	0.005421782656381502
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality .	12.214411670342912
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other , make it urgently necessary to define those rights .	0.14785312482219257
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting .	8.053862304353089
But if we are to secure the public ' s participation in this new planning , we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century .	0.8494781451743677
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children , as entities in their own right , in the Commission ' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century .	0.14949352627674142
Mr President , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , in my opinion , and as Mr Prodi said this morning , the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance .	0.0002437217500546489
This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project .	7.481741209165984
In this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .	0.1338944879704226
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions , as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union .	0.43475005493270347
I understand your concern about the rights of children .	19.469658514592318
Many elements of our work , and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs , involve protecting the rights of children .	0.0164322804718106
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully .	19.523287265060034
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children .	12.68733821058455
As for the EU ' s responsibility , the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broadest sense , of children .	0.049272908931119665
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention .	10.093169441356123
Mr President , I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach .	0.18945325029217905
However , I should like to ask a slightly different question .	0.04335048124700316
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year .	5.325758354997602
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter ?	3.820353451991628
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process .	14.54336217432501
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has .	6.995515263883491
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ?	2.1044411103440415
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is .	0.7317089676507719
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights .	7.2121331163235745
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text , a text that can be easily read by the citizens , and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument .	0.0980541787227668
There is no contradiction between the two .	17.816661032425145
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter .	7.747467591731971
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here .	12.439039250822097
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00) : Subject : Articles 6.1 , 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .	0.0002456244278404382
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jrg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria .	5.085275590155084
Therefore , will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1. ' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council ?	0.05888181536644701
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government .	0.03777798290590569
This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi ' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jrg Haider ' s Freedom Party .	4.971582137628168
I am referring ,of course , to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000 , the basic elements of which I would like to restate .	0.0039854502965725735
The Commission confirmed then , as it does today , that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement of 1 February 2000 .	0.02596086975493143
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them .	13.281109852840373
There is no need for me to remind you of Jrg Haider ' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements , which are also anti-European .	0.4941381193016701
The fact that an openly extremist , racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project .	1.034568494635439
The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either .	23.878756722828534
Secondly , the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties , specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union .	0.054893384344962104
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States .	4.875742991820934
Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled , and which would react if any of them were violated .	0.344581976850375
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars : that of the rule of law .	0.1918685919637294
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made .	8.861955005017368
The Commission is not a State .	65.60514446111273
It cannot and must not act as if it were one .	14.538513112460276
In order to give a precise answer to your question , Mr Ford , I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied , there must be proof of the existence and I quote , of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6. " I repeat , a "serious and persistent breach " is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State .	0.048233801821243955
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria .	8.830186842492132
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled , either in Austria or in any other Member State .	0.9416833864856314
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission , as stated once again by President Prodi this morning , to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7 .	0.14441490701075463
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .	8.40908335502879
The values at stake are too central , too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises .	0.16275753183552372
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say .	7.293862727894945
In Austria ' s case , the statements are contradictory to say the least .	0.06883572378260906
On the one hand , any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party .	0.20236767382619889
On the other hand , the new Austrian Government ' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights .	0.1413822386008076
We will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one .	0.04314624647696074
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission ' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives .	7.004751686065393
One applies to the principle of treating people equally , without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin .	0.3281892329878048
The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin , religion , handicap or sexual persuasion .	0.02459919713530377
These are significant texts , adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty , which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race , ethnic origin , sex etc .	0.0009309887925600981
Lastly , I would like to assure you , Mr Ford , that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities , should it prove necessary .	0.0010494644757784478
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question .	14.030378488775316
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware , not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words , but also of their deeds ?	0.0028654426623705965
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens , where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities .	1.0155682969334454
Could the Commissioner answer two questions .	24.151466213843324
Firstly he talked about verification .	52.098756688502576
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?	2.634727408040031
Secondly , does he not agree that were the current government , at a national level , to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level , then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1 ) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action ?	0.04782742839513033
We are not talking about words here .	31.607496276987685
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider .	12.399892484482836
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty .	5.568479699698935
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria , as in any other Member State .	0.3545388121019389
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs , we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly .	0.4775145305671107
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament , but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations , which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission .	0.06478859408951437
Regarding the situation in Carinthia , we need to look at this in detail .	0.10035066429732652
The honourable Member raised the question .	23.553191018412026
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council .	5.768221320748064
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question .	21.7659448826354
That question calls for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action .	7.564158554881564e-06
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination , racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur .	1.4612544780463554
Thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your valuable contribution to this Question Time .	0.001069262466859202
Second part Questions to Mrs Wallstrm Question No 41 by (H-0021/00) : Subject : Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes ' worth in 1998) , mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent .	0.099404701298301
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chrome , PVC and halogenated flame retarders) .	0.0021763006043546214
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions , the most recent of which dates from July 1999 .	0.3945900600401397
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft , which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998 ?	0.07995501381009003
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2 ) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade ) if it is adopted ?	2.8469804569333945
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems .	6.270760600873962
Consequently , the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and , since 1997 , has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned .	0.0015190583896031076
The outcome of the discussions , as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area , are now being examined by the Commission .	0.028532463207616234
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised , among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants , as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .	0.14582486026443972
The United States ' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper , inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned , as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers ' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .	0.34430695876304734
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are , they say , incompatible with international trade law .	0.03093116816512804
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States ' arguments .	22.628352579923938
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter .	7.259614125042511
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft .	7.550345445240779
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one , to my knowledge , dating from July 1999 .	0.014066500976187443
Is this the text which you will be submitting , or an amendment to the original version ?	0.04305426352708805
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government .	5.1689708410381865
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible , you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation .	0.5542419061368649
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules .	6.489732321734278
This worries me because this means that , when adopting texts , we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation .	0.019122137171894437
This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal .	9.52805773009198
Thank you for the follow-up question .	49.01836192040916
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it .	24.56461415210902
It is clear that in a process such as this , where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe , there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned .	0.10842175847998455
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal .	9.004481901892254
Parts of it have been strengthened , but other parts may well contain too many compromises .	0.10107015354075567
We are still in the process of preparing a text , and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment .	0.28246716927239673
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations .	6.318280314282143
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards .	5.394167122264753
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these .	17.31295000166911
However , I do want to listen to all the points of view .	0.06762486189560626
For example , I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal .	0.1243905350964947
However , I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive .	0.3493151779697486
In fact , I believe that we should be showing the way , an intention that will also characterise the final proposal .	0.004352113926445689
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00) : Subject : Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations , civic action groups , governments , the World Bank , the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment .	0.001499463838423466
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well .	4.407861514915549
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field ?	2.962664637811706
In 1988 , the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .	0.033719902533746765
Through the current programme , which covers the period 1997 to 2000 , we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration .	0.11837275503407366
One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods , strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility .	0.4033513401355873
Within the framework of the action plan , each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures .	0.19790053064381785
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions .	11.772422105984973
The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office .	7.044733669238948
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment , where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women .	0.4447696001565405
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions .	6.40761136359744
Currently , women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts , and we hope the number will increase steadily .	0.0002545125087599321
Moreover , we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups .	0.12482300647187596
As regards our external partners , all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes .	0.30948744099307385
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam .	0.01547887185034004
Article 3 of the Treaty states that , in all the activities referred to in this Article , the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities , and to promote equality , between women and men .	0.0013313154984764834
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field .	5.974601508602426
I should , of course , like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament ' s Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities , particularly its chair .	0.004999676114154048
I should just like to recall that , during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission , every Commissioner was questioned by the Women ' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field .	0.13550403889343723
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully , so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned .	0.1151425975413816
Thank you for your reply .	45.95358261120939
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields .	5.721661808680044
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes .	6.092116072775149
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work .	6.866476706082797
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes .	8.668976815604132
This is a crucial goal .	97.39992831696388
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality , it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required .	0.4035261194856956
.	1.0
(SV ) My understanding of mainstreaming is , of course , that this should characterise everything we do .	0.0012141113497032491
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General , issues of equality play a very important role .	0.12768781555072392
For example , I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission .	0.10939201637182644
If we are to be able to motivate everybody , I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .	0.023595040962515326
My impression of environment-related work , broadly speaking , is that in many instances it is dominated by women .	0.003348858997101076
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field .	5.464296081206277
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention , but there is certainly room for improvement .	0.2430016557705747
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up .	12.808990811493949
I hope that this will be of benefit .	32.924713682881254
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00) : Subject : The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA ) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive , as it is an area of international importance .	0.05933195900755761
However , the Department of the Marine , Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence .	0.21760588745781687
What is more , a very large warehouse has been constructed , in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation .	0.07332224224782219
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?	3.1940799379394997
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?	0.05868783619476154
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour , but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member .	0.3907305581310235
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan .	4.582007667511519
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive .	7.702876214356033
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community ' s Habitats Directive .	6.203529295332901
Since 1998 , the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan , which are now designated a part of the special protection area , and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed .	0.014218845798342964
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced , in the summer of 1999 , that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour .	0.16833063299577986
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .	10.544809942863804
The most serious harm caused by the project , the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats , was only to be temporary , and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats .	0.0054827987555900425
At the Commission's suggestion , the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area , from which they had previously been excluded .	0.027217842476247023
Furthermore , to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats , the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved .	0.06110058742530463
However , since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute .	0.07890175439806793
Firstly , the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements .	0.08419835677505377
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts .	6.166548130940463
However , the new commitment included some minor changes which , in turn , led to a further complaint .	0.00012493106210493187
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved , the Commission will not , for the present , propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended .	0.022504277519823732
However , it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities , particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts .	0.06718606957797336
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said .	16.89802515351279
The mudflat at Stregrennan , which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage .	0.01421766431002147
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives .	8.637382392416464
You say there will be no further funding .	27.875087080260407
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation .	9.642052435849234
If not , why not ?	2.3470372322358666e-06
If you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?	0.00595064127039822
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100% ?	0.37044485095956253
Is this right and proper ?	1.259920655815582
What is your opinion on that ?	1.485993546917209
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives .	9.563759432455468
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed .	7.738604210783128
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done .	12.274252243885606
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place .	5.239885476103976
As a result , the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means .	0.19388947921455274
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary .	4.327852259665477
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge .	10.970490901673921
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior Commission approval .	0.24729433856076277
The Commission ' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met , and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging .	0.7340058541159828
In this case , the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass .	0.4167229029303455
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds .	7.537664349166196
Mr President , sadly , the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one .	0.0010703721369894944
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding .	7.635153514475956
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that , if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out , it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted , in other words , reclaim the money from the Member States ?	0.01510142570736851
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future .	7.277801617070829
.	1.0
(SV ) This is a very important question .	27.386003711975548
As MEPs are well aware , in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission , Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds , money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives .	0.04108740157904143
The message contained in the joint text is still valid .	21.458471873554522
We cannot hand out money with one hand and , with the other , take countries to court , where they may well be fined .	0.001017407073452898
It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy .	21.023440245677552
The result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .	0.00020164150961714597
In my view , the most important consequence , however , is that countries should do some careful thinking and , above all , make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites .	0.00016759325764489422
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures .	13.493165241185936
In that respect , Ireland falls short , like other Member States , but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results .	0.001611685890915878
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good .	10.656255692615566
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this .	25.087896832243285
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber .	21.716434621977086
Questions to Mr Barnier - Question No 44 by (H-0020/00) : Subject : Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC ) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership , involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies , the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding , monitoring and assessment of the measures taken .	0.051841964245343715
However , local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership ' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance .	0.4066532098924685
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies ?	3.50212370210739
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners ' in all measures taken under the new CSF ?	2.697568510712426
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallstrm to Mr Martin ?	1.8517471812690667
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider , as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies , that this letter is still valid .	0.021358237418927457
I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallstrm to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies .	6.4408336460139655
I am also saying this as a former environment minister .	23.1750843800276
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos , who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle .	0.01168587666363824
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community ' s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation .	0.04533118162788729
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece , the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period .	0.7739068686854732
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster .	7.293420697062082
During these visits , I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement .	0.3864166115046074
As for subsequent phases , in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes , it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level .	0.06611200079203879
It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national , regional and local level .	0.19425524186945653
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes , I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation .	0.5355764072773049
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework , I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected , with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations .	0.12443648656530856
Within the third CSF , this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee .	0.2214876280178772
This is all I can say .	18.36942117736798
I thank the Commissioner , and do not at all question his intentions and interventions , which adopted a positive line .	0.007478560739944235
However , things are really quite different .	0.007921452325928436
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state , government and party delirium as regards the European Union ' s funding .	0.7512958666105376
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections .	5.17935536833587
In the Sunday papers all over Greece : the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund : the Minister ' s work ; the Ministry of Agriculture : the Minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications : the work of the Minister for Telecommunications ; the Ministry of Education : the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister ; the Ministry of Employment : the work of the Minister for Employment , a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary , and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework .	0.0
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections .	11.863226558871615
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates , financed by the European Union , the CSF .	0.004480547613690618
My question to the Commissioner is this : what is to be done ?	0.00831703893013514
Will the Commission remain silent ?	1.6475465511928806
Will it discuss the matter ?	1.2599206613366045
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission ?	2.322062598682628
Mr Alavanos , I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited .	0.07944066365475708
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them , after I have had them translated ?	0.058585676601255625
I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy , and what is propaganda .	0.04382613793942859
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this , I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government .	0.19223078875159133
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on .	6.283187981192782
Having said that , I thought your question related more to the partnership issue .	0.0789077995944826
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period , I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations .	0.3248507510568183
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States .	5.306161903697778
It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner .	20.023164455660254
Subsequently , if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised , then I will do this .	0.008053433663692369
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government .	10.317284611277927
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes .	0.7138028064624259
However , turning to the substance , I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following : that for all national and regional programmes , Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration , its central government .	0.008815699783089003
From that point of view , neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations , for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector , have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework , nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs . What can the Commission do about that ?	0.008749625164606178
Mr Theonas , I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos .	0.011874808476984713
I will monitor this situation very closely .	20.68923425305115
If necessary , within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation , I will make comments on the use made , not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed , but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds .	0.003127489920219109
However , I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations .	0.13528301926295114
Having said this , I will look at the situation objectively .	0.036257050376711154
As for the rest , if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing , on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions , provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation .	0.1551653946145746
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years , on the part of the Greek Government , some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society ?	0.08544979334508256
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted , this must be remedied .	0.12401770892005673
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework .	12.083563352949342
- Question No 45 by (H-0041/00) : Subject : Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period , 1994-1999 , no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas ?	0.006492840605999757
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period ?	2.8314515976727868
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ?	0.0015580758597273409
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?	0.0897441726006331
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks ?	2.1750798494570196
On Mrs Isler Bguin ' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community ' s priorities during the previous programming period .	5.487568522847894
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion , or research and technical developments , within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion .	0.005031498056662912
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution .	22.80280103111936
With regard to your specific concern , I can say that , as in the previous period , the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission .	0.021437685914578217
However , it is still the responsibility of the Member States ' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs . Consequently , even though this is not a Community priority , a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area , provided that these projects contribute to regional development .	0.012855452097365019
The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these .	15.839698735431684
On your second point of renewable energy which , as you know , is of great interest to me , the Commission ' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds .	0.01762279598443756
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources , where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level .	0.6922560131533798
I was able to verify this , for example , during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy .	0.03702303401403449
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department .	4.669832455032666
Finally , on large-scale energy transmission networks , the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation .	0.09204916201367773
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions .	7.167015262845752
It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains , for example .	0.06349984493222603
Commissioner , thank you for your answer .	0.007015421345790691
However , I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ' .	0.524106868943754
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds , such as those listed in Objective 1 , might welcome this type of installation .	0.029911011651610118
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research ' context .	6.29217738152716
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks .	6.5791482616722075
Could you please give an answer on this issue ?	1.6917253759551747
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere .	11.198484732047714
Quite simply there is no question of this .	13.545544453300979
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation .	8.743407049287715
As a result , the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .	0.07257760312400033
However , you are right to question me as this is your task , as mine is to answer you .	0.009628081888996968
As has happened in the past , the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification .	0.23305960807098536
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point .	6.727270297503953
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible .	5.083348503735751
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks .	8.0060765586799
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union .	5.178802838851122
Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions , particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped .	0.4241058152707082
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds .	5.905907759339246
- Question No 46 by (H-0052/00) : Subject : Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality , I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality .	0.059813466261055846
In particular , would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States , with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries ?	0.059001058869333954
Mr MacCormick , the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated , for the 2000-2006 period , in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds .	0.003466806176340625
As in the past , these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State .	0.3562616563823444
In this respect , it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional .	0.2963085465018812
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure .	11.411789379399712
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure , the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected .	0.48997370292220094
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States , between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries , these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules .	0.09537625040422433
Please excuse this very legal answer .	34.66191823747861
However , after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle .	0.5715291187845688
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content .	9.240752433917773
We are left with Article 11(1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States .	3.6841521122941363
Very well : that is to be the unchanging rule .	0.004206315493150256
Does section 11(1 ) conceivably authorise the following practice .	15.921785997107
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases , the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region , so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union .	0.16006900372825186
Is that really authorised ?	1.1486982881630294
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue .	11.611789814765682
If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning , I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1 ) in particular .	0.5462945203849822
I am aware of the Member ' s competence on these matters .	15.726911800599408
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects .	5.2449257814881465
However , on a general level , I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional .	0.021316161607222432
This is how , provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure , the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected .	0.08365391476252729
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely .	8.489944560478145
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales , which I represent .	0.046173009951199155
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales .	5.38404030413955
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality , at that time linked to the RECHAR funding .	0.28901344243074645
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional .	5.357354008527287
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland .	11.040980284353337
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government ?	2.700897840440708
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales .	8.662917169745102
I will verify this point and , if you wish , I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick .	0.0420698254200811
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00) : Subject : Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission ' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP , the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants) , what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period ?	0.06521449908209122
Questions to Mr Bolkestein Mr President , I will try to be brief in answering the Member ' s question .	0.1591458409811821
The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive .	3.905800267211238
As I did not fully understand the plan , I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs , Mr Rato , in a letter of 14 December which I have here , to ask him for more information on the document submitted .	0.0048572648182093284
In the coming weeks , the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006 .	0.520903030932681
During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation .	8.131512521422934
Therefore , if you wish , as soon as I have this information by sector and region , I will personally send you the information on Andalusia .	0.0031293754186264944
Mr Commissioner , the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia , he counts all of them , but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services , he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians , and this is very serious , because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada , full of children .	0.005259014070144415
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud ' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians , so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia , based on the census , will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services .	0.2887483828754211
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters .	0.503717745418039
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints .	15.243584134545163
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government .	8.237411520793483
You may answer the question .	33.50060242688096
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I hear that you have a strong voice .	0.06248675054414387
I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me .	6.050701460495277
I have given you my answer .	31.78511322491133
I am keen that the Structural Funds , particularly those in Objective 1 , are allocated where needed .	0.0032255682080196972
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive .	7.888811929504013
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country .	7.799029587284267
I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation .	11.914924133632127
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible .	6.487174688275768
I need to know about this allocation , however , and this is why I said that I could not answer today .	0.011834776751707103
As I did not have an answer , I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December .	0.23760206776766638
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it .	5.18767430279704
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and , in this case , passionate intervention .	0.00673813714642478
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections , and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections .	0.3533767367415489
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again .	0.863518464825816
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds , which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks .	1.1540640284406025
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question : Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable ?	0.43011638442854794
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related .	16.33136748030539
Having said this , we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union .	0.11955498448421106
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain .	12.969074648935546
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .	0.17210169711378645
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life , even when we disagree , the better this will be , provided that we talk about this objectively .	0.006057387108889665
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation .	11.317638621753241
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years .	8.595393990759447
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects .	5.446350204360398
The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted .	9.20539817899757
For the time being , please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin .	0.3825302399239405
This is all I can say today .	32.42958922161713
Thank you very much for your replies , Mr Barnier .	0.011261459879139367
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing .	8.802689406950316
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00) : Subject : New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM ) is still operating from the same temporary premises , even though its new building was opened in June 1999 .	0.030001029844449446
In view of this unusual situation , will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises ?	0.07420272853383868
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time .	5.2018650885379145
Furthermore , I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market , that is to say the Office in Alicante , to comment further on this new question and I can , as a result , inform the honourable Member as follows , on behalf of the Office : The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building .	0.001487814028858756
Unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .	0.023689005177955778
A number of technical provisions need to be made , such as the installation of a computer network , archives , a canteen and furniture .	0.0018350524228055957
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June .	6.664421794622667
During the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .	0.030746291178818087
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question .	17.77128663518386
Commissioner , you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening ' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June , in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections .	0.14270301924526888
If you had been there , I am sure you would have been ashamed .	0.09882738757649111
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present .	23.34970287427316
In the middle of an election campaign , a series of authorities , all of them run by the party in government , made clearly electioneering speeches which , furthermore , were broadcast live on television .	0.0003925155815064696
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government , as well as his own work , although it was irrelevant to that event .	0.07730369250174855
The opening of a building which was not finished , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied , makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous .	0.010713959106060671
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish , because at the end of the day it was their responsibility , but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing , through its presence , this absurd event .	0.009536014348448692
I would therefore like to ask you , Mr Commissioner : does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign ?	0.006977621373220734
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government ?	2.403655312096244
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another .	6.425743668393218
As such , I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described .	0.06569700657400429
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain .	6.804623046428484
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .	7.523833852664675
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference .	7.993919213926103
I hope that this building will then be occupied .	24.588241048180816
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question .	14.805057683831448
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons .	0.5060880249424524
A year later , it is still not functioning , which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening .	0.010505576280104947
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .	10.279098740566669
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions .	11.29228107694704
It is , however , interested in official statements and actions .	3.6228728049616274e-05
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procs d'intention .	9.762130664141717
We are concerned with public official actions and events , rather than any possible underlying motivation .	0.14250699649538726
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question .	8.777977416886143
Once again , the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned .	0.029111034675525154
It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible .	4.726127740906265
Also , the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual .	0.1218797242338371
As far as I am concerned , all expenditure is real .	0.03358712368140038
And any remaining skeletons , I intend to leave them in the cupboard .	0.06976286988783018
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00) : Subject : Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden , and the associated import restrictions , and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied ?	0.016449907947584934
I would like to answer these two questions as follows .	18.8681962744205
When Sweden joined the European Union , it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States .	0.2003299192934499
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year .	5.952530440668982
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years , as this would be necessary to protect public health .	0.18096506583687125
My position on this is clear .	33.64211478631853
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist .	5.112646064957894
I cannot see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be proposed .	0.0031928982815214563
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use , including taxes , in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them .	0.14781860752851658
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time .	7.238082849855135
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market , just like other citizens of the European Union .	0.20798761196218915
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse .	6.558466386644107
A recent study , carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund , however , has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden .	0.008542446237405639
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm , the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions .	0.30549626019869996
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week .	8.314622878458493
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures .	12.568639484360308
Thank you for your reply .	45.95358261120939
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission .	5.918823021776092
Instead of 2004 , it should , of course , be 1 July 2000 .	3.155809720346678e-06
I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally .	10.682548421206222
Such a rule is only normal .	34.661920555744445
Nevertheless , I should like to ask two questions : Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations , for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations ?	0.008208392644204626
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .	17.39405172051775
This may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole EU .	0.0006336429178880949
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work ?	2.043731598404385
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market .	6.952924393198109
It also has important implications for public health .	18.106963532807004
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context , then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden .	0.2989594826953726
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows ?	2.1593047694398213
Firstly , Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003 .	0.26362197577257585
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003 .	6.268453219075188
However , in the case of Sweden , the situation is different .	0.0002349246923057095
In 1995 , a five-year derogation period was decided upon , which is now lapsing .	0.00040849607465288744
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period .	9.956756555124118
Secondly , the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way .	0.03264413493510096
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday , 6 March , in order to talk to Minister Ringholm , to members of the Swedish parliament , and , if necessary , also to the Prime Minister or other ministers , in order to continue discussions on this matter .	0.000267395842137868
I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue .	6.21189983551803
Thirdly , I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important .	0.15040730242962067
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated , namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions , the consumption of alcohol will remain the same .	0.05885065702456388
The question is then , of course , where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers ?	0.00191341302045985
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves , and as Mr Andersson knows , this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity .	0.054442333105097725
Well now , Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol .	0.09357927687442234
But in that case , not only Sweden , but all EU countries , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol .	0.0013092913388003174
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States .	6.909008431907249
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition ' .	11.185730903101682
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States , where , eventually , prohibition was withdrawn .	0.0019293466026499167
All this means that we need to protect health , of course , but not by banning alcohol , because that does not work .	0.0007318879523652319
Mr President , the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs , then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves , with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal .	0.03584691699451713
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget .	3.968344179380384
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .	7.023851947310309
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then , the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state ' s tax revenue .	0.7820770996827614
As is known , this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which , in itself , is at odds with Union legislation .	0.0006726489297889458
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which , I believe , Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him : I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant , and perhaps Mr Posselt , Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit .	0.02000487384296108
Mr President , I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market .	0.0994236308929796
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin , which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France ?	0.7651964678904448
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice ?	2.9996982978761992
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member , since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission .	0.2709349027626024
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice .	6.624131096040741
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now , but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks .	0.5623952480841936
I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision .	10.797574686151515
Commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health grounds , for a difference in the taxation rates on , for example , Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer ?	0.00015883990132018074
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe ?	1.6406696533679375
The matter of excise taxes , to which the honourable Member is referring , is the prerogative of the Member State concerned .	0.010205468904958917
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .	5.869176511231253
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States .	7.747010201508987
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs , which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States .	0.6320601877633297
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France , whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom .	0.45768588886847417
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom .	6.038776852193585
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax .	6.837968396602969
The Commission has no means of influence here .	28.332781701210788
In the case of Sweden , the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol .	0.17469308692812135
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol .	4.702653378455668
There is ,of course , elasticity of demand , in this case a price elasticity of demand .	4.611112041250547e-05
I am not sure exactly what it is , but it is not zero , therefore it must have some effect .	0.007889196839334072
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis , but I would like to press the point further .	0.28572822908375395
Granted , as you say , that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle .	0.0452518445498654
For example , if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of , the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe , very hard-pressed , a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky , Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine , seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States .	0.025976594938622463
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market .	5.072291949592109
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .	17.05618922325944
If one looks at petrol , for example , one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland , and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany .	0.00940712903401967
That is indeed distortion of the internal market .	9.40181653759749
If I had my way , I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe .	0.14747812867547186
As a result , smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another .	0.294234320700418
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way .	13.681306624868068
This is an area of unanimity , as Mr MacCormick knows , and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes , it will not happen .	0.0045069306783225545
Once again , towards the end of this year , the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes , and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report .	0.00754634943669401
Thank you very much , Commissioner .	0.0010244419272122105
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine , although we do not know how much tax is put on it , but I suppose it is a lot .	0.11645265831186455
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing .	0.33971463498605603
That concludes Questions to the Commission .	10.261548854288577
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m . and resumed at 9.00 p.m. ) Community policy in the field of water (continuation ) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy .	0.009167273811779097
Mr President , the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but , in general terms , it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease .	0.026042256950801198
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East .	6.702027414530843
In fact , a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania , threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia .	0.008071245500259573
I understand that Mrs Wallstrm , whose presence here tonight I appreciate , is going to visit the area .	0.006588847949666822
I believe that no country , no government and , of course , no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin .	0.05415271437925019
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex , involving diverse interests and divided opinions .	0.22005879993351238
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , Mrs Lienemann , has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions , and has succeeded to a large extent .	0.005828013384544998
However , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .	0.12344715608133969
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain .	5.5756205668734555
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity , century after century , year after year , day after day , and is still doing so today .	0.0019303742978267575
Therefore , it seems essential to us that the directive complies , in practice , with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions .	0.020911817033255457
In accordance with this principle , the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21) , 13 and 49 (Article 11(d) , since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States , that is , the regulation of water resources .	0.0032503628107433185
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions , given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests .	0.9541404550958273
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .	10.301481193241887
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which , at the same time , safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development .	0.061965783680422055
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero , or close to zero , degree of pollution .	0.03751819228290568
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .	7.350171855034058
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions .	5.409599968585961
I hope that , once again , this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity , seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations , the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much .	0.013688426498727042
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a very important directive .	2.5162365681606124e-05
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .	10.088394587567318
The public must have a right to clean water .	19.994408560430305
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health .	17.17219357179338
I am not speaking so much for myself , as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home .	0.5678485111256548
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .	8.733539776519045
Action must get under way immediately .	37.79909028455939
We cannot afford to waste time .	41.47233110326767
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .	21.741916764532533
In my opinion , the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then .	0.5555574872379704
It is a question of doing what is technically possible ; obviously it is not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious .	0.036748076998364125
I would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .	0.10218077552340392
I believe the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water .	0.29418597940858654
This is not merely a problem for Spain ; it is one for the Nordic countries , and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters , when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive .	0.04199590844801669
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , congratulations , Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work .	1.2787969066795104e-05
Water and air surround us everywhere .	34.661917160720954
We share them with everyone on this earth .	20.998629465647447
Water is a prerequisite for human life .	31.95351591397999
And there are more and more of us in the world .	13.050207345588166
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .	10.207714060405452
Nothing could be further from the truth ! It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so , too , the conditions for life .	0.04104900666575363
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources .	7.374046948038576
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order .	6.538950787219977
Mr President , we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann , the targets it sets and the directive under discussion .	0.006059797798329647
However , we should look a little more closely at some points .	0.05289186460228768
For example , a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes , which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments , and which , of course , are a great risk to ground waters , water tables and surface waters .	0.00033286282503127606
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent .	0.3974434314618079
But the key issue is , in my opinion , planning how to restore water tables , the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes , which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind .	0.00487023061055771
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding , because , at the end of the day , that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy .	0.003966695864162579
Mr President , here we have what is basically a good measure .	0.008448040208872578
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management .	9.724983087784992
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking , for wildlife , the environment and economic purposes is right .	0.0022562566363692315
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood .	7.1226434792251565
We have three outstanding problems .	47.18707245005739
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas .	20.038069609751087
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain , Ireland and the United Kingdom .	0.11026994353142698
Amendments Nos 4 .	110.23572677606117
49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed , be that arid areas or urban areas .	0.6565788809779247
Secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless .	0.00042373855637523045
Looking at Amendment No 7 , for example , which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances , you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic .	0.00368424386325476
Also , some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English , that is quite a meaningless term .	0.012004175078375834
We need to look very carefully at those .	28.720603566950423
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better .	10.539793760162345
Thirdly , I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky .	0.024728668731716703
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream .	0.2934972915501601
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk .	14.008632019301466
We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality" , which means it must use good , Scottish peat water .	0.10393168151991257
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole .	5.52198796533441
Mr President , first of all , we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water , but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia , aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded , have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too , making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous .	0.004025102737294956
Turning to the report , we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata , or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation .	0.2025602573556257
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country , and especially on the islands , funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water , by increasing not its cost but its quantity .	0.03231286165038034
This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste , running off into the sea and eroding the soil , with all the problems that creates .	0.06505599699592078
In that spirit , we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos .	0.06639555315956644
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought .	8.70701681657856
Finally , as regards the Council ' s allegation , which the Commission echoes , that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein , this is chicanery .	0.00831664390336317
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action , which during the directive ' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business .	0.46024592926304475
Mr President , first and foremost , I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment , both surface water and groundwater , is probably one of our most important duties of all .	0.000656447799171921
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is , to a large degree , about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future .	0.11400493666387004
We are all entitled to clean drinking water .	17.037474584519423
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann ' s work on this matter .	8.667456183480688
It has been a huge task , and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann ' s amendments .	0.24907706527093723
These are all improvements to the common position .	12.055117454416575
Moreover , I shall only highlight the most important ones .	0.03853819380250157
First and foremost , I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years .	0.5744758807752408
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position .	5.926975483201816
And , finally , I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we , as consumers , are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and , at the same time , obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which , I believe , there is broad agreement .	0.001025134141963017
In this regard , too , I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate .	0.0007042656947466763
Finally , I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges , emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but , at the same time , be set a target , namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero .	0.011510395782120148
If this cannot be adopted as the objective , then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .	0.6734882481132907
I think that Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council .	7.901380719365525
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive .	0.05138965797703888
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement .	0.9309036420621954
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act .	11.14325206720548
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come .	4.596745741196806
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU .	4.629128565207372
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water .	5.514476712881841
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean , natural groundwater .	0.22040132014904398
In Finland surface waters are very clean .	25.246757992776267
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves .	5.376325607243598
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant .	17.594066868486127
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work .	18.071825508940744
Deviating from the Council ' s common position , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water .	0.04111623918498931
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed .	9.725006554389502
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts .	13.427962856069637
The work should , of course , be regulated and subject to license in the future too , but the same rules cannot apply to , for example , Finland and Greece , which suffers from drought .	4.0933179457674235e-05
Mr President , Commissioner , water is a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it is our duty to protect it .	4.197547793986606e-05
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union , which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources , and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view .	0.2374097543115895
I must say , however , that , there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water , and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way .	0.0014734340387596147
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be taken into account by this directive .	0.1788754292168546
In recent years , climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain .	0.21411950327389187
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled , whose aim is to improve it .	0.39040203647515215
However , we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water , granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers .	0.06874519648850286
In addition , amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage .	0.1571036438286077
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought , I think , to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it .	0.006137598287127692
As for the time scale demanded for the directive ' s implementation , it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive ' s implementation will take time and considerable resources .	0.7658918722560747
In spite of these remarks however , I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained .	0.22855709416429315
Mr President , Commissioner , the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans , comprehensive information and hearing rights , and close cooperation between the Member States , to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants .	0.00035775409704644803
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind , I am pleased to be present here today , and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us .	0.12620075954891188
However , it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted .	0.1875410413627626
I would still like to highlight this point though : this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State ' s territory against its will .	0.6068400653802377
And by way of reaffirming this once again , I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow .	0.6995543504012914
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it .	4.864648747874241
I am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water .	0.016864902490815438
I believe that every one of us , in every country , could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way .	0.06150939191449436
This applies to every country .	53.78628365352214
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources , when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries , only then , in my view , should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage .	0.01030526981287787
Mr President , Commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .	0.0007476828966495005
However , I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality , it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings .	0.09457843908647041
Firstly , I believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .	0.0015744857037232165
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done , although I know that this is not pleasant .	0.7547907119396822
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations , because in many cases the problems concern management .	0.22559758762946017
It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative , the complications of which we are all well aware of .	0.5666401327851864
This is a reductionist directive .	97.43018426007674
We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water , where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55C or 60C in the sun .	0.654489846300989
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court .	13.779633727954696
This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission .	8.849982677737637
In the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in Romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .	0.0008940896816093071
Furthermore , it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas , climatic diversity , desert areas and arid areas .	0.0012637798056361006
That is how the common position has been worded .	24.198839978939276
The same can be said with regard to transfers .	25.909756186523218
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth , of solidarity between peoples and territories , because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less .	0.06339880221586443
Lastly , I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact .	0.3045782624159204
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but , on environmental questions , we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people , how many farmers , could be ruined by having to pay the costs .	0.006693314307528424
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read , and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice , rather than just laying down doctrine .	0.0887253344707273
Mr President , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union .	0.11082354675324246
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and , in our case in Ireland , cross-border level .	0.003218135187831562
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments .	21.065466637919805
A 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable .	0.0001484813842517981
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays " principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level .	0.39969131129007235
However , I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , cooking and sanitation .	0.01016838623678315
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly .	5.712219844363494
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 .	5.462144118646575
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements .	0.618822243669483
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU .	7.486140426885219
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource .	21.472468578508945
Ideally , I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges .	0.38784353792284576
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges , with each Member States drawing up its own scheme , so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected .	0.1590695559483278
If Amendment No 45 does not fall , I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services .	0.99771976299644
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .	11.147417152883358
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world .	7.583788397971985
Mr President , Commissioner , at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which , from an agronomic point of view , and since I come from a southern country , I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive .	0.0010678290971129732
These include , for example , costs and transfers .	2.208309378503706e-06
With regard to costs , I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about .	0.1057926807132624
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water ?	2.0239523161307456
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks ?	2.724538144575579
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?	2.5121678426831155
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs ?	1.7631814529651682
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .	5.955785538223078
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas .	11.784155177948799
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe ?	2.196568021382519
They already existed in ancient times : they had them in Roman times , although on a smaller scale .	0.006319569487472289
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years , almost 30 years , has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year .	0.062434436345763976
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200 .	5.394169424003541
We cannot be accused of bad management .	30.808237625940244
Is the Commissioner aware that , of this 263 hm3 , we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante , 30 for water supplies in the area of the Jcar , 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Jcar and the rest in the Segura , equally divided between supplies and irrigation ?	0.004951796464578433
We are not doing a bad job of management .	18.381770673529005
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it .	7.575838567944543
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies , because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive .	0.45562921249507904
Take good note : in this diverse Europe , which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation , we have to find diverse solutions , not single solutions .	0.0005261853291095689
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission , the Council and this House so that , when voting , they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required .	0.010946147567078918
Commissioner , Andalusia is not Lapland .	0.0052833600726087775
.	1.0
(SV ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I want , of course , to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive .	5.52726058825419e-05
Water is one of our most important natural resources , as many speakers have already said .	0.11159196612245847
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe .	7.7550528662818135
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office .	7.613131188602863
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament .	7.746306905940032
Many of them are based upon the very constructive , informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading .	0.5151203847099369
Most of Parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious .	9.6765363891039
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .	0.006288021212442691
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .	9.926567155418777
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations , I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position .	0.2624953692035203
Firstly , I should like to mention some of my most important arguments .	0.06842851759816
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention .	7.870153807405265
Rather than make these objectives legally binding , we must consider their political nature .	0.06566585011334966
This is also reflected in many of Parliament ' s amendments .	15.221368045456954
Where water charges are concerned , the present directive will constitute Europe ' s water policy for the next three decades .	0.224932049966654
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way .	4.237343291286586
It sounds good , saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge .	0.2957895774614082
But water is not free of charge , any more than houses or food are free of charge .	0.1380910963938175
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource .	5.807501074761016
I also want to add that , when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities , I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules .	0.11080487932556324
I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances .	25.246751495662426
In the course of the debate , many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed .	0.36059808881127775
I just want to emphasise this further .	39.15042241492615
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them .	6.26028876867706
This is also expressed in Recital 14 .	34.355453795665845
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that , in common with my Scottish colleague , he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again .	0.07198333615382299
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production .	9.759814772190603
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail .	13.047891642019684
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives .	9.674095854194894
I am glad to see that Parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this .	11.840102360047734
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text .	8.254361258364694
We must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .	6.786912256531223e-05
As I said , their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character .	0.09677270142376226
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable .	12.877609660275647
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables .	6.95631280094063
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 58 , 60 and 88 .	5.18932511038627e-07
The Commission cannot , on the other hand , approve Amendment No 19 , in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR .	0.0008454142166620694
The Commission ' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances , and so no definition is needed .	0.16707793631037451
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106 , these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR , and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments .	0.05088289610522035
The Commission can also , in principle , approve Amendment No 60 , according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances .	0.005766547175588342
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .	7.012745650354881
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot , therefore , be approved .	0.0026263148576044174
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved .	4.8444201768620685
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances .	7.382082793529441
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector .	5.509732743277266
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .	9.209886397298096
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services .	6.667000597026778
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way .	6.166504782175597
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs .	9.881162736439045
I can therefore partly , and in principle , approve Amendments Nos 43-46 , together with Amendment No 85 .	0.00031275713004343445
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector .	8.539861968281349
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured .	9.916318327682552
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105 , which is in line with the Commission ' s original proposal .	0.20274353444084395
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources .	8.1376717588137
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .	6.6662964137157745
This must not , however , be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .	0.002241758235836132
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question .	10.49094824137687
I agree with Parliament that the common position ' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced .	9.130033974530006
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years .	7.3688700641625795
Amendment No 28 , cancelling the third extension period , is an important step in the right direction .	0.003931849697061681
This proposal can therefore be approved .	24.92221358781703
A period of ten years , as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26 , among others , is , on the other hand , too short .	1.0234747072352784e-05
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided .	5.542690690444441
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water .	4.4585593180483905
This applies to Amendments Nos 6 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 78 , 80 , 102 and 104 .	0.0
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .	5.357091741313593
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29 , to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension , would be going too far , and these cannot be approved .	0.0076901660106929335
Another important area is protection of the groundwater .	20.40293689669073
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution .	8.076310954143466
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring .	15.09881199854734
The most important parts of Parliament ' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle .	7.583858527993601
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is , however , too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose .	0.008087529861792318
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution .	10.949220586087407
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater .	8.131317106965513
The proposal cannot therefore be approved .	25.834727205238966
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality .	5.124482670928437
Instead , we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area .	0.28320193703210916
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled .	6.248748085003678
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot , therefore , be approved .	0.0001342992890616601
The Commission appreciates Parliament ' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role .	8.674366711117877
This approach and its scope , which the Commission can in principle approve , are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47 .	0.010335039268695626
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality , we wish , however , to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision .	0.003122278600879472
The transfer of water is already covered by controls , but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer .	0.19901469157601628
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can , therefore , be approved .	0.00034844633541632994
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted .	7.647852102840886
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned .	6.332319892736933
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot , therefore , be approved .	0.0003484463515131298
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal .	5.481581670617733
To summarise , the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .	0.0001662144139976818
The following amendments cannot be approved : 1 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 39 , 40 , 51 , 59 , 61 , 64 , 66 , 70 , 71 , 71 , 72 , 74 , 77 , 79 , 81 , 83 , 87 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 95 , 97 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 106 and 107 .	0.0
Finally , I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views .	0.6593972941953439
Important progress has been made , and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions .	0.12205301639208423
A number of obstacles remain , but I am convinced that , as the legislative work progresses , we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of .	0.007020792606901151
Parliament ' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious , European water policy for the next three decades .	0.3504988166883661
I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45 .	14.528649075528076
I may have missed it in the list she gave out .	16.92238919397919
.	1.0
I accept that .	89.64041603441308
Thank you , Mrs Wallstrm .	1.8226773085942903e-05
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m . Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE ) The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE ) (Rapporteur : Mrs Lienemann) .	0.024077276562426593
rapporteur .	1.0
(FR ) Mr President , we have already had the opportunity , at the first reading , to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House .	0.010376102984521842
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget , and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years .	0.7665571822114547
Despite the enlargement which has already taken place , when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriations remained the same .	0.004791178734878768
And then we see that , increasingly , the regions , the various operators , businesses , associations , are submitting LIFE projects , both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT , projects that are of excellent quality , which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support , but we still cannot fund them , for lack of budget appropriations .	0.0
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget .	5.868100889079868
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .	8.319681243746563
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular .	15.947474195731418
We are well aware that , in the European Union , a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation .	0.03374989525485807
With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objectives of these directives , and their capacity to be implemented .	0.038710049705571466
And , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .	0.03814089134059726
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues : firstly , comitology , an ongoing debate within this House , but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament .	0.06372414715573267
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union ' s financial programmes and instruments .	11.049339773827619
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget .	5.6877720357577095
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations , not a vast sum in the Community budget , and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus .	0.055355681303590955
I feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of LIFE , at least , there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment .	0.0008008685946273882
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working .	9.86897280897483
This is the essence of how I understand the situation : we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly , that , basically , the Members of Parliament should drop their claims , particularly claims on the budget , for if we do not soon , in line with the codecision procedure , get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE , then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay , and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations .	0.0
I would , however , like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date .	0.05194449821501849
As for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .	0.004349442249431303
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .	0.7796101532896398
I think Parliament often protests about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council , and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs , since , the truth is , it is something of a tradition , which the Council has kept going for a long time .	0.002444726924088272
But I should like to stress the fact that , on this issue of the environment , the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal .	0.11704304964004106
I therefore hope , firstly , that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other .	0.2742858502542977
Mr President , it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission , and I will refer to this later on .	0.024398972748325556
It is equally true , however , that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II .	0.022896160390572986
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous , more transparent and more rational .	0.18628223043999423
Secondly , it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations , which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading .	0.02005172902795833
Specifically , these are : to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects , and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination .	0.010900234899040857
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve .	19.384268857219247
Thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step .	0.5892150870892231
In spite of all its virtues though , LIFE III ' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument ' s impact , which is its budget .	0.08709720903812762
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004 , and by refusing to accept the European Parliament ' s proposal of EUR 850 million , the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced , and rightly so , for other measures in LIFE III .	0.056241878361153214
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument .	6.260490616580944
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice .	10.72582208919207
Firstly , LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union .	0.1436148856170689
There is no other such policy .	55.296534526737005
Secondly , LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results , and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation .	0.04405318244391547
Thirdly , the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand .	0.27535281654196914
Fourthly , as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE , it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget .	0.013274487988185465
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend .	9.509293028287944
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however .	0.03459361563948698
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House .	5.358971623460909
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water , as well as for reducing greenhouse gases , they should be adopted .	0.15757628595117573
Lastly , I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though , as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment , we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee , we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly , it was worse .	0.04652618711546495
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , LIFE is the European Union ' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment .	0.012730199819246463
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .	0.0003735220742356696
Obviously , the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III .	0.2064476673354907
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004 .	12.058139387331027
This is not enough .	81.3936323824496
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million .	0.24411653766807653
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged , without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals .	0.5005946247762048
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .	11.77319879099169
Quite the opposite , it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded .	0.11390795918733611
A drop in the ocean , I might say , in comparison with Europe ' s structural policies .	0.005743892145780022
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget , even though it is primarily an investment .	0.2503367348158795
An investment in natural resources , of course , but also in employment , since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs , as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE , a success with NGOs , businesses , local authorities and third countries .	0.00017598076305847625
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .	0.08653055229309044
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated , and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project .	0.3580864894313358
In matters of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of forms , and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term .	0.025687184978422123
This is the price of the future of generations to come .	23.832228529214174
Mr President , Commissioner , I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that , as far as the Council is concerned , the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE .	0.0026861116721952484
I shall therefore reiterate that , as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly , LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union ' s policy on the environment .	0.07253640680393096
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe , which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States .	0.37515438193984213
This financial instrument is , furthermore , deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations .	0.005988185900912901
That is why , ladies and gentlemen , I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE .	0.03190421461656154
Through the associations , then , LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly , and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community .	0.00724174891218927
Several million NGO members - millions , I say - recognise in LIFE the Union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage .	0.5137520506248716
LIFE is , moreover , the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot , pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds , and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States .	0.02338742819357374
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies .	7.646301671081698
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States , a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds .	0.7168058227095291
Let us not forget that , to date , LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum , i.e . scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union .	6.886897710038506e-05
For the record , the budget for agriculture , which has a real impact on the environment , amounts , as we all know , to EUR 37 billion .	3.8186733511332596e-05
Against this background , my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million , since we know , and I think it bears saying , how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council ' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is , especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice .	0.08209271180146088
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those .	19.592419521492236
Mr President , the European Union environmental programme , to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million ) has been allocated , gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds .	0.004008154741229331
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective , and this is not the case for the following reasons : poorly defined selection criteria , dubious uncoordinated operations , assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy .	0.009450050897149327
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .	19.48783636465497
Firstly , to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies , subsequently , following invitation to tender , to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations .	0.0019449765433605668
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions , since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions .	0.37518173875707395
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection .	0.498773460050467
Secondly , to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds , in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism .	0.026325866486933552
Thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite .	0.07728928258918862
For example , the LIFE-Nature project in France , at Grand-Lieu Lake , planned without any coordination , led to a real ecological disaster , the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau , a water course located downstream , destroying spawning beds , filling wetlands , and who knows what else .	0.00023420491822669857
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres , at a cost of FF 6 million , the cure being worse than the disease , and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site .	0.019520006023890493
Result : a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself .	0.15770623976501302
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid .	17.140144629109614
Four , to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee , at least one Member per political group .	0.006194026807823918
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for ?	3.233501381249997
Fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out .	0.0033552204653398495
Six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis .	0.08815505586542328
Seven , to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency : for example , in reforestation following storm damage , or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick , etc .	0.0007310623926886209
Here , Mrs Lienemann , Mr President , we are putting forward here a practical proposal , a common sense proposal , easy to implement , likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies , before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40% ! Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out , and also the Commission - why not ?	0.0
- because this report , this position , generally improves on the texts in force .	0.0008201180766482203
Furthermore , it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent .	0.06167619265713349
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects .	0.07283197033148518
However , I would like to insist on certain points .	0.02710210265463967
Firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , I am not questioning .	1.5619189113763457e-07
Secondly , the financial contributions .	0.001974113720157811
Sadly , only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds .	0.001056515495826163
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested , only EUR 784 million have been granted .	0.09382009648266361
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences .	8.184634313189456
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million .	0.09238417080563327
Commissioner , our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas , while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing .	0.014799132919723321
Is this not a contradiction ?	1.414212646218082
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?	3.4181022628570092
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us , but rather expect the usual people , the ones who live there all year , to pay for it and maintain it ?	0.017218055575423875
Commissioner , we must be consistent .	0.0022310155090021783
The cost of maintaining the environment , which we all enjoy , must be met by all of us , and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective .	0.016583871751588156
Mr President , LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy , both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries .	0.03473264155822184
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .	0.8564378969485535
The funding of activities for the implementation , adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies , particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development , are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon .	0.040839753229342655
An important element of LIFE-Nature , which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network , is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities , so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity .	0.033972898064636416
In the second , LIFE-Environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .	0.00923439769030805
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years , I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann .	0.05681394185855347
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection , there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years , and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies .	0.1116237130153384
Besides , we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries .	0.29752462234236055
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive .	7.311688334813606
Consequently , I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community ' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement .	0.8350784880715747
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening .	0.0267671146546495
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic .	13.594579973307397
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue .	9.244577373631465
For five years , I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation , which assuredly does not have Parliament ' s broad perspective .	0.06022963988904959
The environment is in a parlous state .	34.80806074065266
Like a number of previous speakers , I , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the pubic domain .	9.42913235202577e-05
As regards funding , EUR 613 million is not enough .	0.03350159832202609
Even EUR 850 million is not enough .	18.7659829092827
At the end of August 1999 , I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million , or ITL 4 000 billion , should go towards eliminating or , at any rate , reducing smoking .	0.0025061468607720278
However , the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking .	0.08161279010682566
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me , is not enough , in practical terms , to allow any type of project to be carried out .	0.0060281029352510515
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established .	7.476394145521806
But creating parks with very limited financial resources , without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual .	0.14132904367686064
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention .	13.518836465660454
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , ever since the beginning of 1999 , discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE .	0.014370203985603042
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter .	0.41258034080261696
As a result of this , I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .	0.08876573333437095
The Commission welcomes , above all , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 , which apply to the Committee procedures .	0.0
In these cases , Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position .	0.1982047331148757
The Commission can , in principle , also approve Amendment No 4 which ought , however , to be introduced into another place in the text .	9.168155103439391e-05
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6 , I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , are to a large degree covered by LIFE .	0.03733913227358689
The Commission nonetheless considers that , if this is stated separately , then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas .	0.055195517546388004
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research , Technical Development and Demonstration .	0.5046075710247624
The present programme ' s key measures - water quality , tomorrow ' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions .	0.4137077310602229
Where the question of the budget is concerned , I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .	0.03227797815678474
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position .	6.320902644121232
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential .	21.25516897652384
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget .	6.673462367085796
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not , however , tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000 .	0.013337809676853628
Allow me also to add that , if the budget is increased , greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with .	0.10530249203361335
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure .	9.179449968789271
At this stage , the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .	0.09790205885672129
With regard to Amendment No 3 , which we did not approve at first reading , I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives , conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid .	0.03082282580814718
It is therefore meaningless , and often impossible , directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments .	0.005339494744718891
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project , more resources would , moreover , be required than are available in the present situation .	0.0036695296913156743
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity , this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid : one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources .	0.11381721782201654
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14 , which is contrary to the Commission ' s right of initiative .	0.1924230343424383
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline , I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000 , as set in the common position - must now be moved forward .	0.10901616353699368
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted .	9.012964479356649
Finally , I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community ' s environmental policy .	0.703935705950134
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument .	17.553990394787412
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible , especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries , especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE .	0.3366716796367987
Thank you , Mrs Wallstrm .	1.8226773085942903e-05
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m . Modernising social protection The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000) , by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999 ) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)] .	0.023795877300944363
Mr President , the issue of social security systems is an important one .	0.013738839289690215
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU .	12.85680991515457
The basis is monetary cooperation , which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy .	0.16116033637682878
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems .	10.078841984292145
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another .	17.553992593919478
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment .	11.601401344071313
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision .	25.475503900423686
But the reverse is also the case : a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .	0.29482417632226926
In other words , social security is a factor of production .	0.03581191553142589
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another .	10.603630772700484
This is largely due to historical factors .	27.268004618119136
We are now faced with a number of common challenges , however ; demographic development , for example , which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate .	0.0026585046361673258
The labour market is also changing .	39.183052254411415
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers .	14.0605032796106
Another challenge is presented by technical development .	20.689233914296008
We must meet these challenges together .	34.66192390645369
The Commission ' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared , a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced .	0.2556341191261972
What is more , the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment .	0.21626222303748652
This is good , but it is not enough .	0.009829679094808476
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process .	17.056191119510196
Clear guidelines and indicators are required .	27.706628816185
At the same time , the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans .	0.08941578790239299
We are creating a common model , but retaining the principle of subsidiarity .	0.06622649233903356
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period .	10.096934681988715
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group , but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on .	1.157657119254386
Like the work on employment , the Commission ' s proposal is founded upon four pillars .	0.08084065109947426
These are : to make the systems employment-friendly ; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term ; to promote social integration ; and to guarantee sustainable , high-quality health and medical care .	0.00012165626744442602
All this is important .	54.44447740930399
In our report , we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area .	0.5434934341896421
Equality has no pillar of its own .	12.572375966628515
There , it is mainstreaming which applies .	0.006372526083555378
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality .	16.127914859325443
This is something we have borne in mind .	23.91172938327945
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect , for example , that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems ; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems ; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life ; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living .	0.008903079998570977
These proposals favour women especially .	52.09874468226994
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence , a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required , together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees , accompanied by a concrete timetable .	0.02880870297761558
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .	9.936851627227151
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union , partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping .	0.37695295496596765
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement .	7.396006418178291
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee .	17.593750163048295
We had a lot of amendments , but succeeded in agreeing upon a report .	0.07506607264416787
Now , the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen .	0.27431216103053985
This indicates that we have a broad consensus .	26.402415429635028
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading , and these I shall reject .	0.16556978614923443
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members , because I do not think that these add anything to the report .	0.4522741008403476
On the other hand , my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .	0.013755993046740451
I think this proposal is a good one .	37.68495046254701
Certainly , it resembles Amendment No 1 , but Amendment No 14 is better .	0.0012396430616784268
Finally , I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade .	0.21413442779847341
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice .	17.431061240037117
In creating a citizens ' Europe , social policy has an important role to play .	0.07067538736043141
By means of this report , Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society .	0.17147074417155278
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy .	7.604873665714015
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind .	8.22748421158155
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Andersson , very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion .	0.0009629556772757337
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People ' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into .	0.5913922630973608
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report .	5.723363506291997
The goal of the Commission ' s notification of June 1999 , on which the Andersson report is based , is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection .	0.0736371778459625
Key sub-goals are : promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income ; secondly , safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable ; thirdly , promoting social integration and fourthly , guaranteeing affordable , first-rate health protection .	4.592925179458279e-05
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals .	16.95735603351705
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification , for these four points are , in fact , to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought .	0.03256287245708549
The Commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence .	9.479940657054376
Macro-economic policy , employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together .	0.13270866051762142
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness .	53.02625440296311
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is , of course , underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy .	0.016647500794664226
These aspects are very much interconnected .	44.2068800590044
It is , therefore , surprising that this topic has , to date , not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission ' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way .	0.0006388911599118856
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon .	5.731796030566015
We should , of course , not get overly excited about it .	2.4281824583261088e-05
It marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process .	0.0003117545295937446
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue .	8.609372933872477
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .	13.222476982465427
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another .	9.406561406746025
The challenges are different .	76.99634920223657
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless .	7.2659007110762355
In this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges .	0.09076931025828475
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen .	8.42849358947372
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report .	0.6616817229994288
It is a report which tries to give direction .	21.377089615029885
There are , however , one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific .	0.008359185160680346
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this .	12.485332784492112
But that does not take away from the fact that the report ' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon .	6.830043116638824
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way , Lisbon will turn out to be a success .	0.32852644900333405
If it is not adopted , Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past .	0.23356451608311005
As far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of Lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before .	0.0009578354374037533
All in all , I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report .	0.12099364866310557
I hope that Europe , in terms of social protection , will make a step forward , taking into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible .	9.074700820669355e-05
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like my fellow MEP , Bartho Pronk , please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report .	0.00018827741133620166
Commissioner , the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance .	0.4708950581882822
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward .	8.45218549669144
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit , which intends to find out how we can put economic growth , employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society .	0.2717319046200935
Within my group , it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon .	0.4691592756986286
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that , in fact , a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000 .	0.1557750659202825
However , we , the Parliament and , in particular , the group of the Social Democrats , want Lisbon to go one step further now .	8.316938347603794e-06
It is of great importance that , in our fellow MEP ' s report , this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence , based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy , that is to say it should encompass common goals , guidelines , national action plans and performance evaluations .	0.0022001987225784224
We believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable .	0.04430394652223165
Needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level .	0.09817935639216041
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this , and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda , and why , in fact , scenarios such as Danny Peters ' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground .	0.0110550763135781
But this new course of action is very exciting .	15.921781076769363
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary , for our social security systems are facing the same challenges , and in an EMU era , social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition .	0.0318865752898291
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group : social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation .	0.3878388491700051
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation .	9.710361185261725
I think that it also a good thing if , moreover , the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001 .	0.20152665916052723
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope , Commissioner , that we can also count on your support .	0.03461240481549748
Finally , we urge the European Parliament , both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process .	0.00973665753197644
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .	6.5334530723123265
Mr President , the four chief objectives which the EU countries ' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows : that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income ; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable ; that social integration should be promoted ; and that sustainable , high-quality health care should be guaranteed .	0.009601653523363667
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them .	7.733646135105413
Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from .	4.627214416220329
The Commission ' s communication , which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November , is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union .	0.4559494227150367
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many Member States .	0.2182400616039336
If reforms are not got under way , we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security .	0.057358114877362504
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .	9.528721501455571
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU , we often use the expression social convergence .	0.15244137118607098
As liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies .	0.40829364256261663
It is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .	0.00020014748522362332
It is , of course , a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy .	0.0009025668843363045
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and , in spite of there being many points of similarity , there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned .	0.1267780046334705
It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern .	15.599829733240249
National policy is , of course , subject to a number of common parameters .	0.0003296975903313719
That is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty .	0.09390027100673651
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements .	10.279479799298688
It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation .	0.2880342215819836
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life .	15.047876007599513
But convergence should be about goals , not means .	0.005730812155221309
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Jan Andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report .	0.05326722065869167
I can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste .	0.19657702178769904
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems , if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries .	0.6168338726679469
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold .	0.8141255249818095
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended , but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same .	0.35589116538697474
There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions .	22.637665747733337
Mr President , Commissioner , with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security , I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me .	0.014313714852433174
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier .	9.749939405988497
This seems to be a good thing and useful .	32.39349874083277
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach .	0.09050237700130494
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved .	8.463105376787196
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled .	13.693661737447202
On the one hand , it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg , but we also think it is important , as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker , that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios , such as sole traders , etc .	0.0010856903532204618
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .	9.297581320199482
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security , which , we hope , will be replaced by high-level convergence .	0.000500449019471158
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union .	3.4487887867703426
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustments , the remainder being improvements .	0.0006524493412600434
The lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans : eleven restrictions and two improvements .	0.21472703315107244
In the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements .	0.11990495342931241
The reasons for adjustments are , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria .	0.00023434181896227606
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries .	22.505766708678458
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries .	8.067926155161139
All in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole .	0.1981156602142399
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches .	8.247068985026921
To use a figure of speech , cappuccino is not always good for us .	0.08884845233428214
Mr President , I would , in turn , like to congratulate both the Commission , for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security , and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled .	0.0001748061168933149
The European Union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .	10.851753925139043
So far , social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources .	0.021924666666471908
But under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated .	0.028595674807016865
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent .	6.112233337130591
Cross-border workers , employees on secondment and migrating employees , as well as job-seekers , students on placement and other students , experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement .	0.0005884679059596859
This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection .	8.32398151081408
In fact , the same phenomenon occurs in tax law .	0.003838989055568585
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping , the Commission has , in my opinion , developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention .	0.0036131473583517907
On the one hand , binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand , programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion .	0.06915908943108315
Based on a number of recommendations , reports and communications , the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials .	0.06576161106508328
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time , with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union .	1.1787459785842902
Indeed , expansion , globalisation , a sharp increase in the ageing population , individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable .	0.00013449659234843688
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection .	8.61980930235822
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection .	0.4153734627456164
Indeed , if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition , this would also harm social protection as a production factor .	0.024627449853752544
And less social protection means less purchasing power , fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees .	0.15623277759665352
In respect of the super-Europeans , I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable .	0.1711156241442695
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions , rightful claimants , revenue or benefits , etc .	0.0010220034842727665
It is thus impossible to bring all States into line .	14.330453561875174
The path which the Commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .	0.00025465402167682916
It has the advantage of clarity , and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid , comparative indicators and put forward recommendations .	0.06687529813747295
I endorse this view .	63.42764520433589
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter .	8.14339812318842
Mr President , Mr Andersson ' s report contains a lot that is of interest .	0.028327306565736447
Unfortunately , what is most interesting is that the report , which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy , instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere .	0.021101559159119928
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States .	9.451916428028458
Even though the socialists , now that there are so many social democratic governments , talk much less about unemployment than they used to , the unemployment in question is still high , and this in spite of the trade boom .	0.0037568767929342444
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody .	7.503613891158838
Social policy must facilitate employment , creating incentives for employers and employees to , respectively , provide and accept jobs .	0.0004458455043247702
Mr Andersson ' s report demands social convergence , that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU .	0.23010810196139195
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria , which would be binding and of real effect .	0.1654484160911221
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination , that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere .	0.1764215071394927
The EU should also , on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds , table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States .	0.03374829668158632
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created , whatever that may mean .	0.2857230352887504
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference .	11.359504850942386
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater .	7.210584512826583
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area .	10.284034962133758
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere , each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences .	0.3661286102999411
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU .	5.310977258110455
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too .	6.695234129295109
It is obvious , however , that these countries , impoverished within a Communist economic system , cannot cope with a social policy like , for example , Sweden ' s .	1.0371874297107313e-05
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned .	6.345122981189043
Mr President , as others have done , I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced .	0.004566331236903729
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State .	0.01960846614261135
I also welcome the Commission's communication .	49.14578639532783
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for .	11.152992254874798
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it .	0.8019594500621686
We can , and must , take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century , a century which is globalising fast .	0.0010457119900534253
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world .	7.9447601608467675
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole .	0.08592219608768878
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative , has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens .	1.0811694670138565
This is not an option for us any more .	21.39311446277593
It is an imperative .	135.7241152579642
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings .	6.456733400805022
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life .	5.454744228755229
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States .	6.534129104644298
That is not what we want to do in Europe .	20.136713629550584
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things .	10.657813657812136
But we have to grasp the tools to do that .	17.759003524714856
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection .	5.3149643669414575
Mr President , Commissioner , this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention .	0.0056794405249539805
Macroeconomic policies , the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people ' s lives , specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes , particularly of the minimum pensions , and through fighting social exclusion .	0.012651371075683487
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , is the lowest in the whole of Europe .	0.5036027908474027
Therefore , while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality , with employee rights , which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid , public social protection system , we harbour serious doubts as to its position .	0.0040023121279861825
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals , including some that we put forward ourselves , we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission ' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection .	0.1662276881659249
Mr President , in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses , one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands .	0.004771182180152644
As the UK business grew , we invested in more people , as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery .	0.010039295346794532
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison .	7.559793465028579
I am in favour of social protection , I am in favour of the original Commission document , but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high .	0.07767428130888404
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment , so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account , and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment .	0.049782615400356105
But I must record that other groups , led by the PSE Group , guided by my countryman , Stephen Hughes , voted this out .	0.000156725012253863
I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned , and I respect him for the work he has done , but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU .	0.09568128109416481
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world .	5.374059406865012
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal , which was very well-balanced , stand unamended .	0.01358628622445358
Mr President , we are unable to vote for this report .	0.00468799033542067
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe .	8.62676354722923
Social rights should determine economic choices , and not the other way around .	0.043372883418086705
This is why , when it comes to social protection , we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale : broad economic guidelines , then convergence criteria and , finally , social issues , dealt with as the last resort .	0.00012907001623180042
The European Union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted .	0.011049422819275465
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator .	7.318839976266658
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems , we need a policy of general wage increase , the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State .	0.04285842069824438
In order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights .	0.13618740223763803
Finally , in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity , the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system .	0.13133931239044916
I sincerely hope , in conclusion , that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes .	0.002823377793790797
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that .	11.69065630371753
Mr President , Commissioner , the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one .	0.00893452205393885
Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable .	7.122417006207598
The labour market and social protection are , in fact , two sides of the same coin , that require harmonised policies and rules .	0.0007286913051180089
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa .	0.013363933734755381
Until recently , the European countries fixed , it could be said in an autarkic way , the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets .	0.0014273969990026495
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability .	11.180735886706689
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness .	0.4046841060947682
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot , therefore , be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade .	0.007432045694683007
That being the case , in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union , and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level , it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria , the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks .	0.017266271084444222
And therein lies the paradox .	47.18706810285416
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems .	5.620731021889298
But , at the same time , the single currency and the absence of labour mobility , as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy , force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare , in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels .	0.005214998802574323
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence , benchmarking , modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions .	0.014647434020202804
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources , genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes , or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which , in reality , only cause harm , above all to the most vulnerable .	0.01803007632384855
That is something we would do well to recognise .	18.24727403635946
Mr President , unlike several of those who have spoken in today ' s debate , I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report , one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission ' s communications .	0.03173756704612501
In particular , I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model ' s approach , which is one based on solidarity .	0.06734537223827548
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping , together with the right to a basic level of social security , the goal of social convergence , and , in particular , the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy .	0.004279078895484622
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union , and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state , model .	0.139839496604121
All in all , though , I deem this report to be worthwhile .	0.0005958670496657931
Mr President , I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe .	0.035252218015430124
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson .	11.940351894275006
Europe , the European Union , although it is very strong in economic and political terms , will remain shaky , weak and limited , perhaps inadequate , if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view .	0.00018141787812905543
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it , but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged .	0.5092896529299148
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income , I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union .	0.6120964928944723
Let us not forget that , in 1999 , 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate .	0.0011964451869518175
In social terms , it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience , as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain .	0.0277805505700849
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes , mergers , take-overs , new technologies etc .	0.00801302030447001
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film states , the postman always rings twice .	0.008809595477682565
In my humble opinion , it is the responsibility of all European , national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion .	0.02651042102871187
It seems to me , Commissioner , that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities .	0.0032393314110102035
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution .	0.007248618842858764
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said .	11.23709184883698
First , I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled : "The future of social protection " and there have been statements from the European Parliament , those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk .	0.06947899396949357
Today , we have the statement by Mr Andersson .	0.012368788472391985
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .	9.434185969751178
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate .	12.019715207836057
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level , but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council , there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience , as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States .	0.05596409869153411
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses , which relate to paid work , the sustainability of pension systems , social convergence and lastly quality in health care , there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies .	0.08655362031876095
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken .	14.373948287397312
As you know , a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency , which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June .	0.030566379365073965
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things : sustainable pension systems and social accession .	0.1275939635705879
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group .	6.068628590997694
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems , the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States , I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion .	0.14680216739596508
Of course , we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness , but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment .	0.03991086493524419
I think the statement ' s content makes this clear .	15.84283659746826
Ladies and gentlemen , the aim is that in the next year , and after a unanimous decision by the Council , we should progress to a first level of coordination , exchange of views , listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies .	0.0036270991635418987
As many of the speakers have said , I believe a first important step has been taken .	0.08462879437069923
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference , social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase , in which social policy will , to a large extent , become a European policy .	0.0022073120686688136
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .	2.3750690709820273e-05
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m . WIPO treaty The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000 ) by Mrs Cederschild , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval , on behalf of the European Community , of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998 ) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)] .	0.00909590099280563
Mr President , we are now taking a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States .	0.0016416461317198805
In my own country , Sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .	0.000750167909902727
It is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products .	8.652229864814235
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty ) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty) .	8.76579604331479
Without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed .	0.07985197261669577
Forgeries are big business .	79.91382712116923
It is estimated that , in Europe alone , income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy .	0.00046960703254847865
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry .	17.925695439050976
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party .	15.006679174830866
This is the case , in spite of the fact that it is not the EU , but only the Member States , which belong to the organisation .	0.002640199393642907
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament ' s assent in two cases .	11.142809654219466
With regard to the present agreement , both these conditions are fulfilled .	0.07693129224567878
A new institution is being created , an assembly which , in the future , will monitor the agreement and its consequences .	0.00043771090583426855
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure .	15.218402694357264
Parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .	0.06635611924977754
The future will show whether it is right , by means of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the Commission ' s powers regarding these issues .	0.02921452947107216
Parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .	0.00017640855951446495
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works .	14.251171199525952
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works .	0.0009479110187218738
It also creates protection for software and databases .	19.59241463477254
There are problems regarding the term "author " .	19.592417744742463
For example , it has not been defined .	0.0012103038816537437
Another issue , which is somewhat problematic , is that of intermediate storage .	0.00010603685304450012
This too has not been solved .	47.287792415337876
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .	10.375995604356957
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this , it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach .	0.029656917701552397
That would not be a good thing .	28.921576998508634
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved , too .	0.03300972413951931
Parliament cannot change these details .	52.09875011164171
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands .	11.268830551812506
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies .	23.10151201519166
Both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes .	0.00013510348365816094
We have here an agreement which , in spite of its defects , constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright .	0.016486578716922922
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law .	5.631132277968739
I think they should have .	33.05402195901453
However , there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs , and there needs to be .	0.013291715575498523
A European patent is in the offing , and that is a good thing .	0.054946698191387706
Now , the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law .	0.28781732631719753
It is good for us that we have the power to do this , in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied .	0.4159652521274273
In that way , we can act as a model for the applicant States .	0.06646003722541852
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement .	13.013771853206146
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission ' s officials , which has been quite excellent .	0.7121540273550855
Finally , I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour .	0.27548149826381085
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Cederschild , on her very serious work .	7.046072163128936e-05
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ' s treaties .	7.767507134640327
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property .	5.751675936391953
It is a fact that the road has been a long one , mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property .	1.0321757446195698
The problem has been overcome .	55.20559589647629
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations , performances and phonograms .	0.03461974980821427
As regards the first of these , it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works , while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution , rental and the presentation of their works to the public .	0.07043509713282167
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms , it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers , interpreters and artists for reproduction , distribution and rental to the public , and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts .	0.019074029976412426
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty ' s treatment of the right of reproduction .	7.356189171735066
Even though , as the Commission says , the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development , it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created , performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives .	0.021907592506575837
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty , we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings , but also protection against copying , whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary , and protection against any other form of production .	0.032470477089684334
It would be appropriate , however , for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences .	0.04832470056948045
First , there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1) .	0.08605368229013276
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty ' s most negative points , since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right , a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists .	0.37429952173216463
As regards rental rights , on interpretation of Article 9 , we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists , interpreters or performers , only if this is laid down by national legislation .	0.0027604585835920574
I think this conflicts with Article 13 .	24.452499168011073
To conclude , I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights .	0.04429799449654152
In the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many cases , be more important than traditional property .	0.0020108954478447716
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created , where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large .	0.7392210557381563
Mr President , I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which , nonetheless , concludes that , as a Community , our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development , however important that may be , i.e . the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together .	0.00020063715588645797
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe .	11.286482249918869
However , an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession , one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States , nonetheless , find too offensive .	0.0007586857240998706
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy .	28.59540197711036
In this connection , I expect our three institutions , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , to be in agreement .	1.7896336163923998e-05
Cultural policy means , in particular , defending the role of the arts , recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards .	0.0009491707801111298
In addition , at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights , there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is .	0.09116811514605454
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them .	8.968580688370546
Mr President , Commissioner , the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society .	0.007382434489914294
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright , and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights .	0.272050566518088
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is , however , in addition to this recommendation , dependent on implementation by the parties themselves .	0.0036672634160332053
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force , having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation .	0.8720343864139558
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO .	7.752137642111711
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system .	9.642479352051717
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted , and , furthermore , the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans .	0.005261066956481999
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe , on the contrary .	0.12461038046733522
Parliament ' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old , in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid , excessive copyright regulations .	0.14534076336990528
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschild ' s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed .	0.035988927045947555
On one point of detail , I would like to thank Mrs Cederschild for having clarified , for example , the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion .	0.002245491105242655
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies .	13.494512965383684
If these , which technically speaking are copies , were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason .	0.0603017937872944
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser .	6.254120737396529
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user , the consumer .	0.15707170360195227
The new operational environment is , above all , a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before .	0.009881348878684143
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .	8.513022035461097
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .	14.441563401716587
.	1.0
(NL ) Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out .	0.21497901411727227
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively .	15.063191614032133
This is important .	79.89661297801995
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur .	14.491849595271399
I would like to present the Commission ' s conclusion to you without any further ado : it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this Parliament .	0.012527144414290139
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties .	24.732048434446888
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are , as such , a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome .	0.07022870529752359
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters , but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks .	0.43593720453488066
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them .	7.2734223428542695
Consequently , approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance , because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights .	0.03556505340347016
In addition , assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union ' s role in terms of copyright .	0.15311210075446613
At international level , there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly .	0.1398493305156522
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States , including the United States .	0.07374746912619604
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union , because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect , and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States , including associated countries , are of vital importance in order to reach this number .	0.02074880611300863
The developing countries , too , expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide .	0.014304046930941876
In this context , Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society , which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999 .	0.08147359377401148
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties .	7.779826661997838
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3) .	10.846781841895131
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world , in the form of this recommendation .	0.16153997615689922
In a nutshell , I would like to reiterate the Commission ' s conclusion here : it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property .	0.11446113779276225
Thank you , Commissioner .	7.516571078922822e-06
The debate is closed .	71.86127219834667
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m . (The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m. ) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .	0.0059507193542390775
Are there any comments ?	1.0899764773977065
Mr President , I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday .	0.058404918216252634
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam ' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled .	7.51381042560045
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport .	34.66191524205863
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival .	10.725817649956218
In fact , it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport .	0.039072521104845104
We finally got here , on Monday at 8.30 p.m. , after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling .	0.00019808959193062388
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless .	7.674769379116653
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg , it could at least ensure , where flights are diverted to Basle , that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers , otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business .	0.03095501638143693
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes .	14.051846574693483
Mr President , I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM , our national airline company .	0.016663375347810462
I hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .	0.008138829602178385
(The Minutes were approved ) Mr President , I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda .	0.21838363736138156
We decided on Monday that the Council ' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed .	8.265638266996518
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today , and not about the Geneva Convention .	0.3740034206132883
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March .	10.14918536219585
It was erroneously included in today ' s agenda .	14.483333349221233
Mr Swoboda , I can confirm what you have just said and there is , in fact , a printing error .	9.41173446838042e-05
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies , because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate .	0.1723848617447393
Mr President , I just want to say that , as I was walking in this morning , I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle .	0.000592856486416111
The smell is absolutely disgusting ! Can you please do something about it ?	1.7239438354998673
I cannot do anything about it myself , but you are quite right .	0.05980979257736134
We need a quick way of educating people , including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House .	0.220962956474416
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays , perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered .	0.9938006552504722
Coherence of EU policies with development The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development .	5.676361794912723
Mr President , it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency , particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future , given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level .	0.054383736413813305
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today , is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy .	0.2576214861437939
I shall , of course , give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making .	0.00309787419259465
I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel , at EU level , to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years , which has benefited people in all walks of life , throughout the world , in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that , at the same time , there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world .	0.012917606686700514
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace .	16.63441980691823
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet .	5.498712231717107
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets .	9.990441305544302
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies .	0.055789037562678376
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas : Firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players , by which I mean donors , requiring greater coordination , greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies ; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems .	0.03233814690962262
At the same time , however , there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems , together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty .	0.03615282629082632
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development .	8.038600354055776
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy , but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance , trade and investment .	0.11025785457162184
Furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies .	0.6962939554295632
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives .	7.660748304116644
Since 1995 , following a concerted international effort between the main donor states , involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD ' s Development Assistance Committee , it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies , both at national and international level .	0.009707598605423286
As you will know , the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015 , by increasing compulsory schooling , by significantly reducing child mortality rates , and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective .	0.009807785386857159
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world ' s population lives , and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people .	0.8505355434027
This is an extraordinary state of affairs , which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively .	0.7172745819808437
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise .	6.62700752074596
Particularly in recent years , development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter , and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership .	0.026956939633528645
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the Bretton Woods system .	0.21759759594426656
I have in mind , in particular , the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank , especially through its Comprehensive Framework document , and by the International Monetary Fund , where , for the first time , an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link , for a body of this type , between debt relief and poverty .	0.000695064659251544
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context .	6.658084500268777
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies , and to create greater scope for coordination , in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system .	0.3351878394580841
If we are to strengthen the European Union ' s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action .	0.391638128600424
Firstly , we need to make the EU ' s development policy more effective .	0.07981398927806939
As you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency .	0.04621953427517593
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues .	7.669338507989704
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies , the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union ' s present cooperation policies , the need to make the EU ' s aid management more efficient and , in particular , to review its mechanisms for intervention , and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid .	0.02458119496144134
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more .	9.09244468449717
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States ' national policies , which are not always complementary or well coordinated .	0.3912809295106573
A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions .	4.9977357467056684
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary .	0.15928227384789723
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies , the central theme of today ' s debate .	0.27591465280551863
Firstly , we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies , so that development objectives can be achieved , not merely through aid and support , but also , first and foremost , through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development .	0.004881367815963067
As you know , a Council Resolution was approved , in June 1997 , under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports .	0.0014316227324024926
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .	0.0019195318266093423
But as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy .	0.019348881862403
Over the coming months , that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us .	0.03783180675267952
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union .	3.752537732200302
Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies .	10.773168067370403
But , quite apart from this , we would like to emphasise that , if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union , we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself .	0.02551985985416134
By this I mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the European Union .	0.00028148109235976164
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics , which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam , which has reinforced its political dimension .	0.03561491310462791
This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development .	10.388355023860212
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement , to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies , and , as regards development in particular , to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective .	0.03135250799045502
The second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policies , is development policy in the context of the Union ' s foreign policy .	0.04265178464003939
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy , and we know that , with the creation of the High Representative , of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity , there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies .	0.04005491328061678
We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue , with the adoption of common positions or joint actions , with the preparation of joint strategies , with preventive diplomacy , and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management .	0.006865495775354624
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union ' s foreign policy .	5.417799365243471
It has to be said that , in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy , the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies .	0.19836199276825672
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy , so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy .	0.693909037322336
In this context , we are convinced that we need to move away from the postcolonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid .	0.30050985276904574
I say this because we know that , in Europe , development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States , in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states .	0.0052373722459321806
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States ' policy .	12.661355650438704
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States ' policies with the European Union ' s development policy .	7.964607698361589
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy .	0.4784510823993141
Ladies and gentlemen , the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention , regarding development policy , is , of course , the Development Council .	4.6690718449304716e-05
There have been discussions , especially in recent months , about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies .	0.014927738585285488
As you know , there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF ' s financing , or rather lack of financing .	0.12736963796128623
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union ' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions , which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils , in other decision-making forums , ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council .	0.1441293081333621
Up to now , the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions .	0.3422897371502711
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impacts on the European Union ' s development policy , is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives .	0.09473406998134601
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome .	0.23895822116048213
.	1.0
Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries .	7.929860258074159
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations .	12.475539007370498
I saw Member States working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience .	0.08924953663562592
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the EU and the 71 ACP countries .	0.01586205682870644
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation .	9.23875354784897
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement .	15.500325284098563
We explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever .	0.33561529301080856
We promote participatory approaches , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU .	0.2355344834649833
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies .	20.998629595511158
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs , but also of its policy performance .	0.24180962363742012
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector .	10.972942486091709
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming , allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme .	0.35122531576144017
We decentralise administrative and , in some cases , financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective .	0.01010411654022884
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .	14.190492968938806
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade , including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade .	0.2852843737488312
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements .	10.2710141863355
Let me turn to some of the more important points .	19.969541250998198
Firstly the agreement on political issues .	37.799085616912635
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support .	0.5558020773337077
Secondly , a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .	0.013203080474109239
In comparison with the current procedure , the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process , with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation .	0.17127149014898296
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified .	0.42839093780291243
Thirdly , the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption .	0.22481886321057767
This is a real innovation , both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general .	0.12807962712015672
This procedure will be applied , not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money , but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development .	0.06663783574952603
It is thus not confined to EC activities .	23.437051135590796
This is a very important aspect , taking into account the fundability of public finances .	0.14101683195834988
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement , the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors .	0.47525969925557593
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration .	16.957356088604687
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area .	8.684923423037482
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999 .	5.766231432433506
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions .	6.475296389737672
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU , and measures facilitating their integration .	0.046845866193784745
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration .	9.714630957989101
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining , within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country , the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party .	0.13194532903132294
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons .	16.875367640474778
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .	13.055255099548527
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid .	5.736241083795628
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters .	5.451603750674087
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned .	8.353059556802743
Negotiations will start no later than 2002 .	28.524562042795264
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations .	6.644365973043838
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations .	14.520614625039963
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways : firstly , through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and , secondly , by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums .	0.028238302590350973
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime .	12.873320812945051
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners .	10.100484946478522
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred , all of which will boost the ACP countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy .	0.4073758354314594
In addition , the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor .	0.014145636968188184
They will lock in the economic reforms , just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties ' commitments under the agreements .	0.2768781072954543
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction .	5.807596362860285
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU ' s trade regime for all least-developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the ACP group .	0.4458225228719825
This process will take place in the coming five years so that , by 2005 , the LDCs ' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market .	0.053522689658242695
As regards the volume of the next EDF , the EU has made its financial proposal .	0.13484032871188223
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective .	5.753565536270411
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted .	0.01760133206542589
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances , plus the new EDF resources , over a seven-year period , that is to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol .	0.0015095302271502828
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period .	7.345175763873923
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity , we are moving into a period of increased activity .	0.3480519159311555
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides .	6.738960539010776
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries .	0.8006403929737049
Turning to our development policy , I would say that the global context has changed drastically .	0.10988411798933907
The marginalisation of many economies , increased poverty in the world , the need for better management of environmental interdependence , the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns .	0.01708684485977695
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves .	13.193453670885795
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned .	5.287051813273609
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations , I would mention the following problems : the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence .	0.06153820416507337
This is due to the complexity of our own structures , but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States .	0.27139886423105464
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .	0.2947652106891265
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available , than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities .	0.12046978652396756
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .	9.710452437013814
On average , to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission , compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States .	0.0002193154226562563
This is a real problem : there are too many different financial instruments , each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings .	0.03838938074161038
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system .	12.192349090055234
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament .	7.913041322832261
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the Council and Parliament .	0.00491844999600526
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed .	6.8358536063127815
By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States .	3.551081618983537
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado .	13.136945852567747
When we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence .	0.09029226320056752
This is part of the solution .	38.51693757864691
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action .	7.707666750168993
Everything has become more and more complex .	31.58158750045897
This is also true of development cooperation .	29.450940169673768
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes , ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reforms .	0.038001929208169166
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country .	6.626942227079539
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action .	7.0881834782199435
This is where we want to go .	27.362480785367797
To identify the EC's priority areas of support , account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions .	0.5236373939601907
I will mention just a few : our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation ; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests ; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do .	0.09324125990948776
Also , our presence on the ground : basically , I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves , we are seen as a neutral , welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be .	0.003465468608556618
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework .	9.520636434098202
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up , by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement .	0.42519282704353445
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested .	10.783290493949986
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate .	4.933565751448807
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect .	4.212591993508667
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing .	5.388377802333285
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson .	0.016424787469416457
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF .	15.771844424801905
The problem , however , should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission ; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget .	0.0018348915739302529
This sermon , therefore , really belongs in the Council .	1.1721216843624937e-05
Mr President , I thank Mr Nielson .	0.0005468656855018097
He has talked extensively about the new Lom Convention , although this is not really the topic of this morning ' s meeting .	0.24485054339720477
We want to talk about coherence .	58.73714566889392
This is the topic .	124.05759916252288
Ever since the early nineties , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies .	0.026147681061787095
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 .	0.004453798728200043
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us .	10.341514020103636
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .	15.03426752437975
In fact , the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 .	0.061745074261603514
In 1998 , it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements .	0.07957598681876242
But what have we seen since then ?	1.4142128822425557
Fine words , as is the case again today , but no report .	0.00012318075239171208
It is too crazy for words , really .	0.008695147217343406
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy .	20.822360528172332
Time and time again , good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented .	0.06984835707846014
It is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .	0.0003011954226569786
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions .	14.14765350716158
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production .	15.854811016021289
In the Union , sugar is produced from sugar beet .	0.02098211274358377
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar , a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar .	0.5227807278527576
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted .	11.334292240371857
At the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .	0.0510050255397204
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union , we would not need your development aid at all .	0.0651904219077623
Another example is cacao .	89.70024244021062
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market .	7.537976992220265
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised .	11.029017188797106
By pitching the percentage level at 5% , which is now likely to be the case , it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage .	0.08152692061645414
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless .	35.215576447484665
What are we actually doing then ?	1.5984886998213652
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does ?	2.1421487726812587
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles , our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries .	0.30513894007563025
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .	20.409755752695954
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma , where an elected President is imprisoned , parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered ?	0.045767417367734764
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan , where a great deal of the fighting is still going on , with weapons , no less , funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are ?	0.002030650546547432
The inconsistency is astonishing .	89.7002294616642
Here too , Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lom Convention .	0.017089472468808663
If the new Lom Convention is simply put into operation , without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy , the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression .	0.07278972894895194
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment .	1.612377423734622e-05
Mr Nielson , what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy .	0.17526922968198308
Once again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground .	0.05932207530163871
This is also at the request of the citizens .	15.45925305778913
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992 : this is the topic of this debate .	0.10201076908209382
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures .	8.66244872726223
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen , I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate .	0.00042450201166845407
The topic touches the very core of the European Union .	6.5942951629203765
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating .	16.06850592734198
Article 178 , Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows : "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries " .	0.140637700772498
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account ?	2.4541751232692515
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them " , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries " .	0.2126185212487655
Mr President , these are no arbitrary objectives .	0.001110374092343921
These are articles , statutory articles , which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply .	0.04393063586526642
Every statutory article should , of course , not just be judged on its regularity , but also on the importance of its contents .	0.0006965691855197894
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens .	6.6303798605185165
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government .	12.605213264915623
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently .	0.09977338225126958
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is .	9.77369694328645
Reality is obstinate .	191.93154808051537
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any backhandedness .	0.3589383845040119
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas , and to show where , when and why , problems occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweeping it all under the carpet .	0.0018736063490519047
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure .	12.080629435366024
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .	10.043206358102415
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens , but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety is pursued .	0.02248615511619551
This is a moral interest , a safety interest and is , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy .	0.00046080922188347195
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers ' money is used to support economic development in Namibia , and if , at the same time , the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies , financed by the same tax payers ?	0.005809939944847003
We are all acting as if this is not really happening , but we all know that it is .	0.14938125318870596
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand .	7.602741818209035
The general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament .	9.358517839770681e-05
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid , however much we like to see him or hear him talk , or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation .	0.12108259773608386
What we need here is an integral approach .	26.820677643208196
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson , I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals , not only by Mr Nielson , but by the entire Commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole .	0.018853376017804107
This is why we urge the Commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instruments .	0.0053908722921742125
We need to pinpoint , and draw up an inventory of , the problem areas for coherence .	0.003420281527089697
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved .	14.592553280052215
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent .	11.489505250599622
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission , in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence .	0.29150266869234676
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking , we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water , but it is , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof .	0.00015024095916032926
The crisis in last year ' s Commission has been solved today , but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution .	0.005037896818189925
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council .	4.983917691137441
Mr President , let us be clear from the outset : when it comes to cooperation , coherence is far from being the watchword .	0.0005912999052298115
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations .	0.05053623587020531
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies .	9.37991766883178
This gives rise to serious malfunctions , because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes , whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done .	0.02982092611192603
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop .	5.345259696938008
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes .	15.928275033711305
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State .	4.838443499370921
The third area of incoherence is human rights .	14.944403729240165
We say that we want to protect human rights .	19.60090160773844
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights .	13.691698916286093
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights .	6.29596013108303
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .	19.592416661594907
And yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines .	0.03102324304324101
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations .	9.348839051891591
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union ' s cooperation policy is this : how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping .	0.5758879560777665
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries .	6.379668385091996
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them .	10.20771395581026
I will not even mention oil ; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa .	0.2847176570094716
Furthermore , and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence , we demand respect for biodiversity , for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature ; but at the same time , and this was apparent during recent negotiations , we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements .	0.0021492864049480987
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south , at the hands of the multinationals .	0.06953453924515389
And yet , and this is the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current Treaties .	0.004743960587116025
On the one hand , we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and , on the other hand , we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS , despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre .	0.02525967919197664
Similarly , during the WTO negotiations , at a time when , to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report , "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries , especially the poor " , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries , albeit with a transitional period of several years , instead of strengthening it , especially for the poorest countries .	0.0026279887576903652
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature .	15.864813747612706
We are always saying think globally , act locally .	0.011732995365559589
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs . And what about agriculture and the environment ?	0.26815244854116516
Still more problems , still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted , not to mention research , emigration or health .	0.0012091796121131225
In short , we claim that we want to help developing countries and , at the same time , we encourage the liberalisation of trade , which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective .	0.0006450697655475641
I say it again , the European Union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent .	0.14185177089386541
and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament , the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy .	0.00926255068834721
Mr President , I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development is in general an important issue , but because it is also a topical one .	0.004707892234467465
Seattle was a failure , and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons .	0.16689156919135498
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries .	6.161825364663198
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok , and is suffering the consequences of that failure .	0.3101356536980441
In the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the Lom Convention have been concluded .	0.0009067809240134743
This goes to show just how topical this subject is .	13.394034131227157
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April .	6.008813007177701
However , I would also like to add that any analysis , no matter how superficial , inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations , including those between the European Union and the less developed countries .	0.01575641473154874
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries " has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years , and now represents 13% of the world ' s population , yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990 .	0.0672207469979428
Furthermore , the recent Community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message .	0.0007934781047035087
Michel Camdessus , a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund , said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference , and I am now quoting , that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other .	0.005095134488348375
He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries .	8.13439829672003
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he did indeed say this , and I heard it with my own ears .	0.03430188717146326
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation , and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould .	0.43697002913981653
In particular , we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area , as I am certain that one of the Union ' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order .	0.08031204715153832
It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation , bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based , and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries , particularly in this context .	0.035876608258713916
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries .	9.809349779563286
This is a positive development in itself , especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue .	0.44895491550535777
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth , but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time , even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points .	0.39699355326633134
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these .	10.824303091897935
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade .	0.07975460440227321
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group , which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle .	0.2837694732622093
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging , especially as regards trade , and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area .	0.06022103805960569
Lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .	0.08015483301590702
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects , indebtedness , assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety , humanitarian , educational and health-related issues , and also fields such as the environment , investment and access to information and new technologies .	0.0002912940706832525
This also applies to the sphere of trade , where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies , and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States .	0.0732897220703619
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed .	8.768049876936098
Mr President , having listened to the Council and the Commission today , I just had to look at my agenda .	0.005272562903110895
Yes , it does say : 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy ' .	0.002155118726245985
But we have not heard a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing .	0.1444371863845911
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .	15.770896463239396
It ought to have been here in writing today and , after having heard Mr Nielson ' s speech , I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission .	0.07305973415773373
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today .	0.38640329918975386
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence , I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect .	0.07664473922206089
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU ' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries : dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa , tomato pure in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica .	0.16176352912603917
The examples are , I hope , all well known .	3.10634929044695e-05
In any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products .	0.6040642517585308
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU .	5.79877084161302
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries , which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU .	0.039197719740376905
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries ' gross national product , compared with 5.3% in the EU .	0.023551847511285896
There is neither coherence nor human decency here .	19.592414893260127
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ?	1.6817917035047623
Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental .	0.009029364601001604
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council .	5.358173169019254
They pointed out that the UK , France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population .	0.4679043731134158
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto .	7.995214663330092
Is the Council discussing this issue ?	1.4859936942443734
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent ?	0.33005875450997796
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ?	0.0032559538937674774
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration .	0.21827153402118463
How decisions are made is all-important .	37.799021514417475
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly .	15.3960603754809
Mr President , I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning , but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about .	0.02837677041527178
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy , I question whether today is the time to be holding it .	0.5614555925854399
However , the Council statement gave me hope for the future .	0.021449895586163212
It is quite obvious to me , as someone who specialises in development policy , that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations .	0.036140608129803325
I will give some examples shortly .	47.28782012160137
However , I remind this House that , back in June 1997 , a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy .	0.026513441922595495
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report , the first of which was to be discussed in 1998 .	0.40658425967572254
We still await the first report , and that is why I believe this debate was premature , as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning .	0.02719111364997111
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace-building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration .	0.0006644243036005996
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth .	27.908651809086237
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State , with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter .	0.6989957267578374
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture , trade , environment and biodiversity , but herein lies the real problem : these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular .	0.013437698103821297
Members of this House will have differing views , even within the same political parties , depending on (a ) which country they come from or (b ) which committee they sit on .	0.0697316711352832
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries .	5.9850486841707395
As a lack of coherence , one can cite as Mrs Sandbk did , the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry .	0.07266184828847135
We have beef exported to southern Africa , to Namibia and South Africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland , so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union .	0.00894782880271731
Remember too , some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years .	0.027248716905158153
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries , rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country , we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations .	0.16007749479656183
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development .	7.065559079608074
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment .	7.722497757730298
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document .	8.509952357132278
Mr President , this morning ' s debate is very important .	0.0048149097167468815
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development , because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective .	0.7726481728997836
However , if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy , we will end up totally frustrated and , furthermore , the result will be negative .	0.0007888628590856851
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out .	0.3476444488450729
The result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise .	0.007196267799048412
With regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another .	0.5276910828392607
In today ' s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious .	0.0906474677260997
There are no boundaries for Community policies .	21.9661337160813
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies , and that , together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission , they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union .	0.06267914317913503
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state , in their respective working programmes , that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries , but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence .	0.060725085427230804
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied .	8.815076921233679
For example , the Commission , in its long term guidelines , says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity , supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account .	0.0012535669062088428
The Commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy .	0.0002140194379545321
However , this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform .	5.835562284677745e-05
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in November 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results .	0.020232015674374434
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say , as some previous speakers have pointed out .	0.48986217277005334
However , as Parliament , we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies , which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves .	0.1406471753051921
What we really want , however , is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination , complementarity and , the most complex one , which we are discussing at the moment , coherence , will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union .	0.0007146970544489272
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference , the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services - , this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement , to perfect a more coherent political union .	0.06276889959891298
We therefore hope that the Commission , in the report it is going to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests .	0.1492283171228479
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence .	0.012397731009070389
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .	8.194674142619052
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures .	0.0063581828863329085
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , real per capita income in the world ' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries .	0.47492953258103365
In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher .	9.033881827998979
And there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed .	15.746172368949097
On the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further .	0.21386095299260233
This is shown by the following figures : the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960 , 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997 .	3.8152310314527644e-05
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off .	14.19049121585968
In other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the EU countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale .	0.012369701077497167
In a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .	0.0025034508954845176
At some time or another , there will be a revolt , and it will be fully justified .	0.004461739481283952
I would therefore urge the Council ' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of Europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide .	0.04956525536507649
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7% .	0.28553370825665625
It may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light .	0.1899803443974576
Above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .	0.0009534509794123216
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade " at all .	5.590198145941025
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States .	5.731780189636093
I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up , not only in the Commission but also in the Member States .	0.4119393340737336
I should also like to say that , in my view , what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from , respectively , the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development .	0.0017976935213361786
In that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission , which is scarcely likely to produce results .	0.009629009229091132
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution .	16.305841532757068
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels , we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications .	0.29810142265584433
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries .	7.092068345698031
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and , in this connection , the EU can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities .	0.014576232601678176
Mr President , "The EU ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired " .	0.06270830489790674
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week , commenting on the Union ' s development policy .	0.2005331302061662
This is not new .	167.82560150349727
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have been called into question .	0.23038007901152266
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror .	6.992869161742232
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ?	2.5919675403442315
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy ' s internal conflict .	12.674354004801945
In terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the European policy is in conflict with the development policy .	0.002949476817744567
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .	11.459090715613861
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation .	6.986636187776551
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right .	0.3168127549735407
I advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy .	0.013263645513973391
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money , it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States .	0.3775288626258172
Finally , I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way .	0.10104584247046058
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense .	0.002702389034298423
As various Members have already commented , we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies , whose objectives run counter to development in those countries .	0.1922374299358629
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fisheries and industry .	8.256649605680775e-05
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies .	6.472411437275024
So there is a whole raft of contradictions .	33.91098784816952
In my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies .	0.12876843720551537
They are , if anything , more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States .	0.0006146738751419036
We have to be aware of this .	19.946192210284256
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world , as was recently the case with Indonesia , when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment .	0.14790241020122397
For me , these are the most serious contradictions in all this , more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies .	0.008209530872041178
We obviously know that , even within any one country , there are always contradictions between various policies .	0.003446680739200163
That is a fact of life .	42.8541730576872
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies , in this case development policy .	0.31233120374203593
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them .	16.452900901344726
The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one .	7.720185674626314
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies , but should also cover Member States ' actions and policies , including the actions of economic groups , which I think are also important .	0.045113432154433884
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction .	7.014854348676114
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House .	6.097173703614581
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective , not merely within the European Union , but also at world level , given the increasing globalisation of the economy .	0.01437307086260971
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations , because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint .	0.4176130803897588
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round .	7.273239506912226
Mr President , the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies , before this spring ' s paper on development policy itself , is like putting the cart before the horse .	0.018848482671788493
Never mind that the Commission ' s requirement to produce an annual report , set out clearly in the Council resolution , has produced only one "non-paper " , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards .	0.14473507215025003
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered .	6.760452115304313
Take the new chocolate directive , which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid .	0.18988451084497196
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries , 90% of which are our ACP partners , estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15% .	0.08337154739623215
Take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters .	0.18351578235645005
We are , at the same time , negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe ' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide .	0.04304190033289003
Take the trade agreements .	74.69188545007803
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lom , preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries " .	0.45673334917845765
In other words , when EU commercial interests are concerned , poverty considerations go out of the window .	0.004640165212574938
In the stance that we took at Seattle , why such a silence on the EU ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT , including for the crucial textile sector ?	0.05151698068365014
On the common agricultural policy , the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms .	0.19395112316751106
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets , slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half .	0.5648682384712796
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes .	15.913986759152987
Who will be next , quite literally , for the chop ?	1.1418392564347297e-05
I welcome Mr Amadeus ' statement this morning , which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF , which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU ' s emerging common foreign and security policy .	0.1716339985332204
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union .	0.22436665864254904
Action simply has not been taken .	30.213882511192026
That is why we want annual reports , we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure , to make sure action is actually taken .	0.03656152048615489
I ask Mr Nielson , in his summing-up , to directly address those points in the resolution .	0.0027849753737422475
Mr President , I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture .	0.05967292829865229
Over the past couple of years , a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and , more especially , the Lom countries .	0.008999183725133917
The results are certainly not what we expected .	26.158609559635813
What could be the cause of this ?	2.44562870249758
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , barring a few exceptions .	0.5688291820128049
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop .	16.298928689794923
No farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low .	0.0004771443891618059
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food ?	0.02821943057985247
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission , and not by the Commission on its own .	0.109198391598366
In most countries where the Commission is active , development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves .	0.21817758460640574
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission .	8.03435890351258
It is up to the Commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach .	7.440352905500711
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .	11.655498953583471
Far too often , artificial fertiliser , veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge .	0.013530392938878765
Once the project comes to an end after five years , the policy of free gifts also ends .	0.1081798124818225
I think , therefore , that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects , and as far as I know , this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination .	0.0022036049544080605
Finally , I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use .	0.11530216125843415
Every year , I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds .	0.014850322794694261
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted , which is a pity .	6.169833212466779e-05
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi , for example , who has missed a great chance right from the outset , for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four , I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy .	0.03355350709539557
We also note that , as before , there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments .	0.00875091684541449
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the European Development Fund .	0.18031538945657455
Parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arms .	1.0322672689658725e-05
If this were possible , it would be a huge , historic victory .	0.0004450115503572705
Since Amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion .	1.2956927802226788e-05
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .	16.434688753498687
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion , if a request is made at all , then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult , unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all .	0.030562248096428095
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion , and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion , for it is a long way off yet .	0.1406516937707859
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council .	4.894326941422386
He stated : "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance. " It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand , and vice versa .	0.00638259126123153
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit , and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes , indeed , but changes which have only made poverty worse .	0.0061140229113401945
This is supposed to be our priority , would you believe .	0.04319204837782508
I know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .	0.28587748245094574
Mr President , we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission , but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion .	0.05027076702231784
The first is concerned with conflict resolution .	30.54587298023787
For many years , I have tried , through the Council and the Commission , to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in , and working for , conflict resolution in the Western Sahara , which is occupied by Morocco .	0.00027750012624259225
The UN has a peace plan .	34.66192392486488
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end .	6.312764916128104
I also want to take up the subject of migration .	24.420422790368836
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries , which might make it easier to expel immigrants , asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds .	0.06406121713647432
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms .	12.47891118404736
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds .	10.518171146836117
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age .	11.669539402186656
This is not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talked a lot about today , namely increasing poverty .	0.028063289964398604
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .	9.183708150260923
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason .	0.35112255324743363
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce .	11.77033007630468
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas , especially development policy when , of course , we are not in reality absent at all .	0.000933669131667068
Mr President , the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid .	0.19408433494962754
The level of aid is naturally important , and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased .	0.2871645458045378
This ought to be done with , in particular , a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity .	0.008349271539339188
However , the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries .	0.2015995477422948
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed .	5.419606015114128
The latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .	0.019360542298809815
Other important areas are , of course , the flow of private investments , cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with , and finances solutions to , a variety of global problems which affect us all .	0.0010308725393407894
These problems include questions of climate , health issues , biodiversity etc , and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation , that is to say the new economy which is developing .	0.00041875077913246857
In this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .	0.08299118866901793
In my opinion , what we are discussing here today is partly the EU ' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance .	0.9590104116005723
The report , or survey , which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded , showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be , is naturally quite crucial .	0.0004617584781886044
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more .	15.36474431055753
The Commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission .	0.4363136282959552
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission .	6.3414653756401025
In addition to a report of this kind , I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character .	0.2735127027394658
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries .	5.289929622403435
These include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc .	0.0005701085620534677
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting .	15.925089731740938
Finally , Parliament recommends , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence .	0.0017710491769494362
I believe it is only a coincidence , but the Commissioner for the Environment is also , of course , to participate in this group .	0.0008510786681523516
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed .	16.473376221652703
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other .	5.0513833443250995
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest .	9.244567127314891
Mr President , the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less - and least-developed countries , it is purely a rich country selfish interest .	0.012984357362584116
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent .	4.6470906153537985
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain .	0.2167679470519965
It did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .	0.030918961275147448
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term , but opening one ' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term .	0.7875892023409563
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular ?	3.3854077861085825
As Mr Nielson said , this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity .	0.15947203913473576
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough .	9.64084594052495
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries .	7.326191726711499
Parliament ' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU .	7.360092714036281
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports , tariff barriers and quotas and , just as important , non-tariff barriers , such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire .	0.01788549363445132
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words .	4.734925098641412
Mr President , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States .	0.0455066317492587
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union ' s ability to match words with action .	6.454714849007302
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes , to post-conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world , particularly in developing countries .	0.049226495345090535
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance , assistance to victims and related activities .	0.21848026510958338
The Member States have spent similar amounts .	44.842320041844204
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span .	6.1721901338416885
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States .	7.051370724723748
This has been talked about for years .	27.00563277801479
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell .	0.047207144599457594
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes .	5.616866146210446
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines .	7.352182820103671
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union .	0.04463191757531466
Are these afflictions of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ?	0.16758777675284597
Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence .	0.001795523380413706
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights , democracy , rule of law , and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously , and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent , rather , we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect .	0.0039098826448843585
For these are prerequisite to any development .	23.37533493180387
If these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance The same goes for Cuba , Mr Modrow .	0.010610743806226773
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process .	11.948982424636759
But for this to happen , there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba .	0.20857982466955557
After all , we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International .	0.010248605055645645
It may well be that you , having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships , view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber , and that you have problems where good governance is concerned .	0.022266156401127224
Nonetheless , these are important criteria for the European Union .	0.013847798456454598
There is a second issue I would like to raise .	18.220358330658726
We are discussing coherence here .	57.52168494104485
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .	10.460460602420776
In my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too .	0.002275680055525879
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .	7.740758078329149
Nor is there coherence vis-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union ' s budget but the EDF remains outside it .	5.395405756132059
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control , and to bodies such as OLAF , then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability .	0.0053641722506528565
This , to my mind , is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do , i.e . establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union .	0.0004991053928446602
Mr President , we certainly must concede that , on balance , this text is full of good intentions , but we did not vote in favour of it in committee , nor shall we do so in plenary .	0.00031290509840697125
We had two reasons for this , both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly .	0.21018519073040726
First , the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF ; clearly that is misguided .	0.005145638802901253
In our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .	9.503806997508442e-06
With Europe preparing to enlarge , communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget , quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy .	0.23625694576500045
Lastly , the Commission has , in the recent past , had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently , as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely .	0.0006046270968898799
Why should we add to them ?	1.6406700996609225
Secondly , we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie ' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because , in the final analysis , this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse .	0.04206130154345916
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank .	7.56369463520934
And let me say in passing , it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to .	0.12299903056681082
As a result , we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed .	0.6838878651489397
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry , port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law .	0.7060694249384163
Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent .	24.539180572303785
It is proof , as if we still needed it , of the fact that immature diplomacy , which defends no interests , unless of course they are individual interests , and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs , is not just inefficient , it is positively dangerous .	0.0008213479334555358
Finally , a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report .	0.05181040496385105
Nowadays , let us face it , the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington .	0.03103118325887072
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened .	7.527919148953352
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must , regrettably , punish it for losing so much .	0.0030382478270639434

(PT ) Mr President , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate .	0.019180874913995647
First of all , many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality , and increases poverty .	0.005844297078048612
This suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen .	0.27596348174859914
Secondly , it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context , taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality .	0.03656689740826912
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union ' s role in international development policies is significant .	9.142353199814472
Everyone recognises , indeed this was the theme of today ' s debate , that , if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level , it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies .	0.008371254338276362
I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council , for the Commission or for Parliament alone .	0.30772005903887983
